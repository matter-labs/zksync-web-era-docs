# Cross-chain governance

This tutorial shows you how to implement communication between L1 and L2 with the following example:

- A **Governance** Solidity smart contract is deployed on layer 1. This contract has a function that sends a transaction to zkSync layer 2.
- A **Counter** Solidity smart contract is deployed on zkSync layer 2. This contract stores a number that is incremented by calling the `increment` method. The `Governance` contract on layer 1 calls this function.

## Prerequisites

- Make sure your machine satisfies the [system requirements](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-compiler-solidity/tree/main#system-requirements).
- You are already familiar with deploying smart contracts on zkSync Era. If not, please refer to the first section of the [quickstart tutorial](../building-on-zksync/hello-world.md).
- You already have some experience working with Ethereum.
- A wallet with sufficient Göerli `ETH` on Ethereum and zkSync Era Testnet to pay for deploying smart contracts.
  - You can get Göerli ETH from the following faucets:
    - [Chainstack Goerli faucet](https://faucet.chainstack.com/goerli-faucet/)
    - [Alchemy Goerli faucet](https://goerlifaucet.com/)
    - [Paradigm Goerli faucet](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/)
    - [Proof of work faucet](https://goerli-faucet.pk910.de/)
  - Get testnet `ETH` on zkSync Era from the [zkSync portal](https://goerli.portal.zksync.io/faucet).
- You know how to get your [private key from your MetaMask wallet](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key).

::: info Local zkSync Testing with zksync-cli
Skip the hustle for test ETH by using `zksync-cli` for local testing. Simply execute `npx zksync-cli dev start` to initialize a local zkSync development environment, which includes local Ethereum and zkSync nodes. This method allows you to test contracts without requesting external testnet funds. Explore more in the [zksync-cli documentation](../../tools/zksync-cli/README.md).
:::

### Complete project

Download the complete project [here](https://github.com/matter-labs/tutorials/tree/main/cross-chain).

## Project set up

Open a terminal window, create a new folder for the project tutorial, e.g. `mkdir cross-chain-tutorial`, and `cd` into the folder.

Now create separate folders to store contracts and scripts on L1 and L2.

```sh
mkdir L1-governance L2-counter
```

::: note

- The `L1-governance` code is a default Hardhat project used to deploy a contract on L1.
- The `L2-counter` code includes all zkSync dependencies and configurations for L2.
  :::

## L1 governance

1. `cd` into `L1-governance`.

2. Run the following to initialise and set up the L1 project:

```sh
npx hardhat
```

:::info
In case of question:
Need to install the following packages:
hardhat@_version_
Ok to proceed? (y)

- Press (y)
  :::

Select the option **Create a Typescript project** and accept the defaults for everything else.

:::info
To interact with the zkSync bridge contract using Solidity, you need the zkSync contract interface. There are two ways to get it:

- Import it from the `@matterlabs/zksync-contracts` npm package (preferred).
- Download it from the [contracts repo](https://github.com/matter-labs/v2-testnet-contracts).
  :::

3. Install the following dependencies:

Make sure you use actual node (lts version) and actual npm version
::: code-tabs
@tab yarn

```sh
yarn add -D typescript ts-node @openzeppelin/contracts @matterlabs/zksync-contracts @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle ethereum-waffle
```

@tab npm

```sh
npm i -D typescript ts-node @openzeppelin/contracts @matterlabs/zksync-contracts @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle ethereum-waffle
```

### Create L1 governance contract

:::tip
Make sure you're still in the `L1-governance` folder.
:::

The following Solidity code defines the Governance smart contract.

The constructor sets the contract creator as the single governor. The `callZkSync` function calls a transaction on L2 which can only be called by the governor.

1. `cd` into the `contracts\` folder and remove any files already there, if any.

2. Create a file called `Governance.sol` and copy/paste the code below into it.

```sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicense
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

import "@matterlabs/zksync-contracts/l1/contracts/zksync/interfaces/IZkSync.sol";

contract Governance {
    address public governor;

    constructor() {
        governor = msg.sender;
    }

    function callZkSync(
        address zkSyncAddress,
        address contractAddr,
        bytes memory data,
        uint256 gasLimit,
        uint256 gasPerPubdataByteLimit
    ) external payable {
        require(msg.sender == governor, "Only governor is allowed");

        IZkSync zksync = IZkSync(zkSyncAddress);
        zksync.requestL2Transaction{value: msg.value}(contractAddr, 0,
            data, gasLimit, gasPerPubdataByteLimit, new bytes[](0), msg.sender);
    }
}
```

### Deploy L1 governance contract

1. Create the file `L1-Governance/goerli.json` and copy/paste the code below, filling in the relevant values. Find node provider urls [here](https://chainlist.org/chain/5). You have to connect your wallet to the network and add the network to the wallet in advance.

```json
{
  "nodeUrl": "<GOERLI NODE URL>",
  "deployerPrivateKey": "<YOUR PRIVATE KEY>"
}
```

2. Replace the code in `hardhat.config.ts` with the following:

```ts
import { HardhatUserConfig } from "hardhat/config";
import "@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle";

// import file with Göerli params
const goerli = require("./goerli.json");

const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
  solidity: {
    version: "0.8.19",
  },
  networks: {
    // Göerli network
    goerli: {
      url: goerli.nodeUrl,
      accounts: [goerli.deployerPrivateKey],
    },
  },
};

export default config;
```

3. Navigate to the `scripts` folder and copy/paste the following code into the `deploy.ts` file (removing any previous code):

```ts
// We require the Hardhat Runtime Environment explicitly here. This is optional
// but useful for running the script in a standalone fashion through `node <script>`.
//
// When running the script with `npx hardhat run <script>` you'll find the Hardhat
// Runtime Environment's members available in the global scope.
import { ethers } from "hardhat";

async function main() {
  // We get the contract to deploy
  const Governance = await ethers.getContractFactory("Governance");

  const contract = await Governance.deploy();
  await contract.deployed();

  console.log(`Governance contract was successfully deployed at ${contract.address}`);
}

// We recommend always using this async/await pattern to properly handle errors.
main().catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
  process.exitCode = 1;
});
```

4. From the `L1-governance` folder root, compile and deploy the contract:

::: code-tabs
@tab yarn

```sh
# compile contract
yarn hardhat compile

# deploy contract
yarn hardhat run --network goerli ./scripts/deploy.ts
```

@tab npm

```sh
# compile contract
npx hardhat compile

# deploy contract
npx hardhat run --network goerli ./scripts/deploy.ts
```

:::

You should see output like this:

```sh
Governance contract was successfully deployed at 0xf28Df77fa8ff56cA3084bd11c1CAF5033A7b8C4A
```

Save the address to use in a later step.

## L2 counter

Now that we have an address for the L1 governance contract, we can build, deploy, and test the counter contract on L2.

1. `cd` into `/L2-counter` and initialize the project:

```sh
npx zksync-cli create-project . --template hardhat_solidity
```

::: tip
In case of any issues on this step (f.e. you did not have a yarn), you may get errors during the recreation of the project environment. Clean your current environment in advance or create another folder and create environment there.
:::

2. For the purposes of this tutorial, we don't need the Greeter related files generated by the zkSync-CLI. So, proceed with removing `Greeter.sol` from our `/contracts` directory:

```sh
rm -rf ./contracts/Greeter.sol
```

3. Similarly, remove the deploy scripts associated with the Greeter contract:

```sh
rm -rf ./deploy/deploy-greeter.ts && rm -rf ./deploy/use-greeter.ts
```

### Create L2 counter contract

1. In the `L2-counter/contracts/` directory, create a new file `Counter.sol`.

This contract contains the address of the governance contract deployed previously on layer 1, and an incrementable counter which can only be invoked by the governance contract.

2. Copy/paste the following code into the file:

```sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicense

pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

contract Counter {
    uint256 public value = 0;
    address public governance;

    constructor(address newGovernance) {
        governance = newGovernance;
    }

    function increment() public {
        require(msg.sender == governance, "Only governance is allowed");

        value += 1;
    }
}
```

3. Compile the contract from the `L2-counter` root:
   ::: tip
   Compilations happens only after the installation of a compiler
   :::

::: code-tabs
@tab yarn

```sh
yarn hardhat compile
```

@tab npm

```sh
npx hardhat compile
```

:::

### Deploy L2 counter contract

1. Copy/paste the following code into `L2-counter/deploy/deploy.ts`, replacing `<GOVERNANCE-ADDRESS>` with the address of the Governance contract we just deployed, and `<WALLET-PRIVATE-KEY>` with your private key:

```typescript
import { utils, Wallet } from "zksync-web3";
import { HardhatRuntimeEnvironment } from "hardhat/types";
import { Deployer } from "@matterlabs/hardhat-zksync-deploy";

// Insert the address of the governance contract
const GOVERNANCE_ADDRESS = "<GOVERNANCE-ADDRESS>";

// An example of a deploy script that will deploy and call a simple contract.
export default async function (hre: HardhatRuntimeEnvironment) {
  console.log(`Running deploy script for the Counter contract`);

  // Initialize the wallet.
  const wallet = new Wallet("<WALLET-PRIVATE-KEY>");

  // Create deployer object and load the artifact of the contract you want to deploy.
  const deployer = new Deployer(hre, wallet);
  const artifact = await deployer.loadArtifact("Counter");

  // Deposit some funds to L2 to be able to perform deposits.
  const deploymentFee = await deployer.estimateDeployFee(artifact, [utils.applyL1ToL2Alias(GOVERNANCE_ADDRESS)]);
  const depositHandle = await deployer.zkWallet.deposit({
    to: deployer.zkWallet.address,
    token: utils.ETH_ADDRESS,
    amount: deploymentFee.mul(2),
  });
  // Wait until the deposit is processed on zkSync
  await depositHandle.wait();

  // Deploy this contract. The returned object will be of a `Contract` type, similar to the ones in `ethers`.
  // The address of the governance is an argument for contract constructor.
  const counterContract = await deployer.deploy(artifact, [utils.applyL1ToL2Alias(GOVERNANCE_ADDRESS)]);

  // Show the contract info.
  const contractAddress = counterContract.address;
  console.log(`${artifact.contractName} was deployed to ${contractAddress}`);
}
```

::: tip Deposit funds during deployment
The deployment script contains a deposit from Goerli to zkSync Era testnet, which can take a few minutes to finish. If your wallet already has funds in L2, you can skip that part to save you some time.
:::

2. Now deploy the contract from the `L2-counter/` folder root to zkSync:

::: code-tabs
@tab yarn

```sh
yarn hardhat deploy-zksync
```

@tab npm

```sh
npx hardhat deploy-zksync
```

:::

You should see output like this:

```txt
Running deploy script for the Counter contract
Counter was deployed to 0x3c5A6AB2390F6217C78d2F6F403A9dFb7e7784FC
```

::: tip
For more information about deploying contracts, check out the [quickstart tutorial](../building-on-zksync/hello-world.md) or the documentation for the zkSync [hardhat plugins](../../tools/hardhat/getting-started.md).
:::

## Read the counter value

Now both contracts are deployed, we can create a script to retrieve the value of the counter.

1. Create the `scripts` directory under `L2-counter`.

2. Copy the `abi` array from the compilation artifact located at `/L2-counter/artifacts-zk/contracts/Counter.sol/Counter.json`.

3. Create a new file `/L2-counter/scripts/counter.json` and paste in the `abi` array.

4. Create a `/L2-counter/scripts/display-value.ts` file and paste in the following code, adding the counter contract address:

```ts
import { Contract, Provider } from "zksync-web3";

const COUNTER_ADDRESS = "<COUNTER-ADDRESS>";
const COUNTER_ABI = require("./counter.json");

async function main() {
  // Initialize the provider
  const l2Provider = new Provider("https://testnet.era.zksync.dev");

  const counterContract = new Contract(COUNTER_ADDRESS, COUNTER_ABI, l2Provider);

  const value = (await counterContract.value()).toString();

  console.log(`The counter value is ${value}`);
}

main().catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
  process.exitCode = 1;
});
```

5. Run the script:

::: code-tabs
@tab yarn

```sh
yarn ts-node ./scripts/display-value.ts
```

@tab npm

```sh
npx ts-node ./scripts/display-value.ts
```

:::

The output should be:

```txt
The counter value is 0
```

## Call L2 contract from L1

Now, let's call the `increment` method on Layer 2 from Layer 1.

1. Copy the `abi` array from the compilation artifact located at:

`/L1-governance/artifacts/contracts/Governance.sol/Governance.json`.

You have to copy only abi content from the file after the keyword abi, an example below:

```json
[
  {
    "inputs": [
      {
        "internalType": "address",
        "name": "newGovernance",
        "type": "address"
      }
    ],
    "stateMutability": "nonpayable",
    "type": "constructor"
  },
  {
    "inputs": [],
    "name": "governance",
    "outputs": [
      {
        "internalType": "address",
        "name": "",
        "type": "address"
      }
    ],
    "stateMutability": "view",
    "type": "function"
  },
  {
    "inputs": [],
    "name": "increment",
    "outputs": [],
    "stateMutability": "nonpayable",
    "type": "function"
  },
  {
    "inputs": [],
    "name": "value",
    "outputs": [
      {
        "internalType": "uint256",
        "name": "",
        "type": "uint256"
      }
    ],
    "stateMutability": "view",
    "type": "function"
  }
]
```

2. Paste it into a new file: `/L2-counter/scripts/governance.json`.

3. Create the `L2-counter/scripts/increment-counter.ts` file and paste in the following code, replacing the following details:

- GOVERNANCE-ADDRESS: the address of the contract deployed in L1.
- COUNTER-ADDRESS: the address of the contract deployed in L2.
- WALLET-PRIVATE-KEY: the private key of your account.
- RPC-URL: the same url you used in the `goerli.json` file.

```ts
import { BigNumber, Contract, ethers, Wallet } from "ethers";
import { Provider, utils } from "zksync-web3";
const GOVERNANCE_ABI = require("./governance.json");
const GOVERNANCE_ADDRESS = "<GOVERNANCE-ADDRESS>";
const COUNTER_ABI = require("./counter.json");
const COUNTER_ADDRESS = "<COUNTER-ADDRESS>";

async function main() {
  // Enter your Ethereum L1 provider RPC URL.
  const l1Provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider("<RPC-URL>");
  // Set up the Governor wallet to be the same as the one that deployed the governance contract.
  const wallet = new ethers.Wallet("<YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY>", l1Provider);
  // Set a constant that accesses the Layer 1 contract.
  const govcontract = new Contract(GOVERNANCE_ADDRESS, GOVERNANCE_ABI, wallet);

  // Initialize the L2 provider.
  const l2Provider = new Provider("https://testnet.era.zksync.dev");
  // Get the current address of the zkSync L1 bridge.
  const zkSyncAddress = await l2Provider.getMainContractAddress();
  // Get the `Contract` object of the zkSync bridge.
  const zkSyncContract = new Contract(zkSyncAddress, utils.ZKSYNC_MAIN_ABI, wallet);

  // Encoding the L2 transaction is done in the same way as it is done on Ethereum.
  // Use an Interface which gives access to the contract functions.
  const counterInterface = new ethers.utils.Interface(COUNTER_ABI);
  const data = counterInterface.encodeFunctionData("increment", []);

  // The price of an L1 transaction depends on the gas price used.
  // You should explicitly fetch the gas price before making the call.
  const gasPrice = await l1Provider.getGasPrice();

  // Define a constant for gas limit which estimates the limit for the L1 to L2 transaction.
  const gasLimit = await l2Provider.estimateL1ToL2Execute({
    contractAddress: COUNTER_ADDRESS,
    calldata: data,
    caller: utils.applyL1ToL2Alias(GOVERNANCE_ADDRESS),
  });
  // baseCost takes the price and limit and formats the total in wei.
  // For more information on `REQUIRED_L1_TO_L2_GAS_PER_PUBDATA_LIMIT` see the [fee model documentation](../../reference/concepts/fee-model.md).
  const baseCost = await zkSyncContract.l2TransactionBaseCost(gasPrice, gasLimit, utils.REQUIRED_L1_TO_L2_GAS_PER_PUBDATA_LIMIT);

  // !! If you don't include the gasPrice and baseCost in the transaction, a re-estimation of fee may generate errors.
  const tx = await govcontract.callZkSync(zkSyncAddress, COUNTER_ADDRESS, data, gasLimit, utils.REQUIRED_L1_TO_L2_GAS_PER_PUBDATA_LIMIT, {
    // Pass the necessary ETH `value` to cover the fee for the operation
    value: baseCost,
    gasPrice,
  });

  // Wait until the L1 tx is complete.
  await tx.wait();

  // Get the TransactionResponse object for the L2 transaction corresponding to the execution call.
  const l2Response = await l2Provider.getL2TransactionFromPriorityOp(tx);

  // Output the receipt of the L2 transaction corresponding to the call to the counter contract.
  const l2Receipt = await l2Response.wait();
  console.log(l2Receipt);
}

// We recommend always using this async/await pattern to properly handle errors.
main().catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
  process.exitCode = 1;
});
```

:::tip

- Executing transactions from L1 requires the caller to pay a fee to the L2 operator. The fee depends on the length of the calldata and the `gasLimit`. This is similar to the `gasLimit` on Ethereum. You can read more about the [zkSync fee model here](../../reference/concepts/fee-model.md).
- The fee also depends on the gas price that is used during the transaction call. So to have a predictable fee for the call, the gas price should be fetched from the L1 provider.
  :::

4. Run the script with the following command:

::: code-tabs
@tab yarn

```sh
yarn ts-node ./scripts/increment-counter.ts
```

@tab npm

```sh
npx ts-node ./scripts/increment-counter.ts
```

:::

In the output, you should see the full transaction receipt in L2. You can take the `transactionHash` and track it in the [zkSync explorer](https://goerli.explorer.zksync.io/). It should look something like this:

```json

```

5. Verify that the transaction was successful by running the `display-value` script again.

```sh
npx ts-node ./scripts/display-value.ts
```

You should see an incremented value in the output:

```txt
The counter value is 1
```
