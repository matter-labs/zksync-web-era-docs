# Estimate gas

:::tip Gas fees
- Layer 2 gas fees depend on the current Ethereum L1 gas fees for publishing and verification.
:::

Gas estimation is usually left to the SDK to deal with. However, there are situations in which a developer may wish to implement gas estimation directly; such as for displaying the fee to the user for example.

This document gives step-by-step instructions for implementing gas estimation for:

- [L1 to L1](#l1-to-l1) transactions.
- [L1 to L2](#l1-to-l2) transactions.
- [L2 to L2](#l2-to-l2) transactions.

## L1 to L1

To estimate gas for L1 to L1 transactions, use the Ethereum `eth_estimateGas` method and send to an L1 node.

## L1 to L2

To estimate gas for an L1 to L2 transaction, first gather the required values:

1. Get the current L1 gas price. 
    
    For example, the Ethers.js library has a [`getGasPrice()`](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/providers/provider/#Provider-getGasPrice) method available on a `Provider` object. Your language of choice should have an equivalent.

2. Call the [`zks_estimateGasL1ToL2`](../../api/api.md#zks_estimategasl1tol2) method, passing the transaction data. This returns the estimated amount of L2 gas the transaction requires; commonly called **gas limit** or similar in our code and docs.

    - Apply an alias to the addresses in the request if the sender address is a contract. If the sender is an EOA, no aliasing is required. This is implemented by the [`applyL1ToL2Alias`](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-2-contracts/blob/7b5c094a57c0606785ea38c9c752f9def9a5ed9d/ethereum/contracts/vendor/AddressAliasHelper.sol#L28) Solidity function.

3. Call the [`l2TransactionBaseCost`](https://github.com/matter-labs/v2-testnet-contracts/blob/b8449bf9c819098cc8bfee0549ff5094456be51d/l1/contracts/zksync/interfaces/IMailbox.sol#L129) function, passing the gas price and gas limit from previous steps. This function returns the base cost required to send a transaction.

    - You also need to pass the constant representing how much gas is required to publish a byte of data from L1 to L2. At the time of writing, the JavaScript API provides this constant as [`REQUIRED_L1_TO_L2_GAS_PER_PUBDATA_LIMIT`](../../api/js/utils.md#gas).

Once you have all of the above, you can send a transaction with the [`requestL2Transaction`](https://github.com/matter-labs/v2-testnet-contracts/blob/b8449bf9c819098cc8bfee0549ff5094456be51d/l1/contracts/zksync/interfaces/IMailbox.sol#L119) function, passing the gas limit returned at step 2, along with the gas price and base cost from steps 1 and 3 as part of the value parameters.

For a more detailed explanation on estimating gas, with code examples, find out [how to send a transaction from L1 to L2](../how-to/send-transaction-l1-l2.md).


## L2 to L2

Gas estimation for L2 to L2 transactions on zkSync Era works in the same way as it does in Ethereum.

Supply the same call data as an L1 to L2 transaction, use the Ethereum `eth_estimateGas` method, and send the transaction to an L2 node.

## L2 to L1

Gas estimation is dealt with implicitly by the SDK for L2 to L1 transactions.
