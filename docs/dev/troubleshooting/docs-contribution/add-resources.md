## Adding content resources

We cannot promise to cover all aspects of zkSync so we will attempt to highlight some of the community's outstanding resources such as videos, tutorials, articles etc.

## How we decide
All learning resources recommended by the community will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Is the content resource current?
- Is the content resource protected by a payment wall?
- Is the information trustworthy? Is it based on facts or opinions?
- How reputable is the author? Do they cite their references?
- Does the content resource provide anything new or different from what can be found in the documentation?
## Add your content resource
If you find a content resource related to the zkSync ecosystem, be free to recommend its addition to the [awesome zkSync repo](https://github.com/0xJuancito/awesome-zksync).
