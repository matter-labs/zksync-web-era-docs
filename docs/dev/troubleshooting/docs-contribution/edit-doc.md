# Edit or review a documentation page

### Goal
Find a documentation page that you think needs updating, proofreading, or editing.

### Background and reference information

[Content style guide](https://www.notion.so/matterlabs/Communication-Strategy-a4836bd6d2254268b60a489d82992d71) - zkSync content style guide.

### Categories of contribution

Review the page, to see if it needs editing. Things to look for:
1. Proofreading (spelling, grammar, punctuation).
2. Does the particular page of interest follow the content style guide and the documentation structure guide, if it doesn't you can edit.
3. 404 links - Make edits and create a PR to fix any broken links.
4. Language translation - We will make a guide for you to follow if you want to translate zkSync documentation to a non-english language.

### Detailed steps

1. In the page of interest, click on `Edit this page`,
2. Step 1 takes you to GitHub: either create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/join), or if you already have an account, then sign in.
3. Click on the pen icon to fork the repo so you can start contributing to the documentation.

4. Edit MD files:
  - We use markdown in the documentation, you will need to know markdown to be able to contribute to the docs.
  - Make edits to the files after forking the repo and preview your changes. If you have not read our [content style guide](https://www.notion.so/matterlabs/Communication-Strategy-a4836bd6d2254268b60a489d82992d71), please do before you begin this step.
5. Write a brief description of the changes you made and click on `Propose Changes`. 
6. After editing the files click on `Create pull request` and wait for our reviewers to review your PR.
