# Try it out!

To get a first-hand impression of the zkSync 2.0 user experience:

- Go to the [zkSync 2.0 Portal](https://zqgai-staging-wallet-v2.zksync.dev/).
- Get some test tokens from the faucet, or deposit some from the Rinkeby testnet.
- Make some transfers.

The Portal will be the central entry point into the zkSync 2.0 ecosystem for users and developer alike. It will contain links to all relevant resources, such as block explorer or the catalog of featured dapps.
