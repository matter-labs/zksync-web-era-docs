# L1 -> L2 communication

This section describes the interface for interaction with zkSync from L1. It assumes that you are already familiar with the basic concepts of working with the priority queue. If you are new to this topic, you can read the conceptual introduction [here](../zksync-v2/l1-l2-interop.md). If you want to dive straight into the code, then you can read the cross-chain governance [tutorial](./cross-chain-tutorial.md).

## Structure

Besides the input parameters of the operations, all of the requests contain the last two parameters: the `_queueType` and the `_opTree`. These are the important parts of the censorship resistant protocol called [priority queue](../zksync-v2/l1-l2-interop.md#priority-queue). For the testnet alpha preview, these two values should be supplied as `0`, i.e. `Operations.QueueType.Deque` and `Operations.OpTree.Full` respectively.

To prevent the users from requesting too many heavy operations from the operator, the user must provide the fee to be paid to the zkSync operator in ETH. Each transaction has _base cost_ in gas and the _layer 2 tip_, which is equal to the basic cost of the requested transaction subtracted from the ETH value passed with the call.

Please note that the basic costs are defined in gas and not in ETH, so the actual amount of ether that the submission of the transaction will cost depends on the transaction gas price. Generally the flow for calling any of these methods should be the following:

1. Fetch the gas price that you will use during the transaction call.
2. Get the base cost for the transaction.
3. Call the transaction, while passing the needed `value` with the call.

Please note that since transactions in `Operations.QueueType.Deque` are processed sequentially, it does not make sence to pass more `value` that the minimal required.

## Using contract interface in your project

To interact with the zkSync bridge contract using Solidity, you need to use the zkSync contract interface. There are two main ways to get it:

- By importing it from the `@matterlabs/zksync-contracts` npm package. (preferred)
- By downloading the contracts from the [repo](https://github.com/matter-labs/v2-testnet-contracts).

The `@matterlabs/zksync-contracts` package can be installed by running the following command:

```
yarn add -D @matterlabs/zksync-contracts
```

In all of the examples below we assume that the interface is accessed via the `@matterlabs/zksync-contracts` npm package.

## Deposit

### Getting the base cost

::: tip Deposit is free for now

For the time of the testnet, depositing funds to zkSync is free (the base cost is `0`). However, you should design your system (and especially L1 smart contracts) in a way that can be adapted in case the zkSync deposit base fee becomes non-zero.

The deposit base cost will be non-zero during priority mode, so it is crucial for long-term stability to keep in mind that deposits _may_ require a fee.

:::

```
function depositBaseCost(
    uint256 gasPrice,
    Operations.QueueType _queueType,
    Operations.OpTree _opTree
) public view returns (uint256)
```

- `gasPrice` is a parameter that contains the transaction gas price.
- `_queueType` is a parameter required for the priority mode functionality. For the testnet, `Operations.QueueType.Deque` should always be supplied.
- `_opTree` is a parameter required for the priority mode functionality. `Operations.OpTree.Full` should always be supplied.

The view function returns the amount of ETH that is needed to be supplied by the user to cover the base cost of the transaction in ETH.

### Interface

There are two separate methods used to bridge ETH and ERC-20 tokens from Ethereum to zkSync.

```
/// @param _amount ETH amount
/// @param _zkSyncAddress The receiver Layer 2 address
/// @param _queueType Type of data structure in which the priority operation should be stored
/// @param _opTree Priority operation processing type - Common or OnlyRollup
function depositETH(
    uint256 _amount,
    address _zkSyncAddress,
    Operations.QueueType _queueType,
    Operations.OpTree _opTree
) external payable nonReentrant
```

- `_amount` is a parameter which contains the number of ETH in wei to deposit. The rest of the suplied ETH is used to pay for the base cost of the transactions and the L2 tip.
- `_zkSyncAddress` is a parameter which specifies which address should the deposited funds go to.
- `_queueType` is a parameter required for the priority mode functionality. For the testnet, `Operations.QueueType.Deque` should always be supplied.
- `_opTree` is a parameter required for the priority mode functionality. `Operations.OpTree.Full` should always be supplied.

```
/// @param _token Token address
/// @param _amount Token amount
/// @param _zkSyncAddress Receiver Layer 2 address
/// @param _queueType Type of data structure in which the priority operation should be stored
/// @param _opTree Priority operation processing type - Common or OnlyRollup
function depositERC20(
    IERC20 _token,
    uint256 _amount,
    address _zkSyncAddress,
    Operations.QueueType _queueType,
    Operations.OpTree _opTree
) external payable nonReentrant
```

- `_token` is a parameter that defines the address of the ERC-20 token to deposit the funds from. Please note that the zkSync smart contract should have the necessary allowance set before this method is being called.
- `_amount` is a parameter that contains the amount of the token to deposit.
- `_zkSyncAddress` is a parameter that specifies which address should the deposited funds go to.
- `_queueType` is a parameter required for the priority mode functionality. For the testnet, `Operations.QueueType.Deque` should always be supplied.
- `_opTree` is a parameter required for the priority mode functionality. `Operations.OpTree.Full` should always be supplied.
