# Tutorial: Hello World

This tutorial explains how to build a full dApp using the zkSync development toolbox.

The following functionality will be implemented:

- There will be a greeting stored on a smart contract on zkSync.
- The user will be able to get the greeting after the dApp page is loaded.
- The user will be able to change the greeting on the smart contract.
- The user will be able to select the token that they want to pay the fee with.

## Prerequisites

For this tutorial, the following programs must be installed:

- `yarn` package manager. `npm` examples will be added soon.
- `Docker` for compilation.
- A wallet with some Görli `ETH` on L1 (Görli `USDC` is also required for the ERC-20 tutorial) to pay for bridging funds to zkSync as well as deploying smart contracts.

## Initializing the project & deploying smart contract

1. Initialize the project and install the dependencies. Run the following commands in the terminal:

```
mkdir greeter-example
cd greeter-example
yarn init -y
yarn add -D typescript ts-node ethers zksync-web3 hardhat @matterlabs/hardhat-zksync-solc @matterlabs/hardhat-zksync-deploy
```

Please note that currently typescript is required by zkSync plugins.

2. Create the `hardhat.config.ts` file and paste the following code there:

```typescript
require("@matterlabs/hardhat-zksync-deploy");
require("@matterlabs/hardhat-zksync-solc");

module.exports = {
  zksolc: {
    version: "1.1.0",
    compilerSource: "docker",
    settings: {
      optimizer: {
        enabled: true,
      },
      experimental: {
        dockerImage: "matterlabs/zksolc",
        tag: "v1.1.0"
      },
    },
  },
  zkSyncDeploy: {
    zkSyncNetwork: "https://zksync2-testnet.zksync.dev",
    ethNetwork: "goerli", // Can also be the RPC URL of the network (e.g. `https://goerli.infura.io/v3/<API_KEY>`)
  },
  networks: {
    hardhat: {
      zksync: true,
    },
  },
  solidity: {
    version: "0.8.10",
  },
};
```

3. Create the `contracts` and `deploy` folders. The former is the place where all the contracts' `*.sol` files should be stored, and the latter is the place where all the scripts related to deploying the contract will be put.

4. Create the `contracts/Greeter.sol` contract and insert the following code there:

```solidity
//SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicense
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Greeter {
    string private greeting;

    constructor(string memory _greeting) {
        greeting = _greeting;
    }

    function greet() public view returns (string memory) {
        return greeting;
    }

    function setGreeting(string memory _greeting) public {
        greeting = _greeting;
    }
}
```

5. Compile the contracts with the following command:

```
yarn hardhat compile
```

6. Create the deployment script in the `deploy/deploy.ts`:

```typescript
import { utils, Wallet } from "zksync-web3";
import * as ethers from "ethers";
import { HardhatRuntimeEnvironment } from "hardhat/types";
import { Deployer } from "@matterlabs/hardhat-zksync-deploy";

// An example of a deploy script that will deploy and call a simple contract.
export default async function (hre: HardhatRuntimeEnvironment) {
  console.log(`Running deploy script for the Greeter contract`);

  // Initialize the wallet.
  const wallet = new Wallet("<WALLET-PRIVATE-KEY>");

  // Create deployer object and load the artifact of the contract we want to deploy.
  const deployer = new Deployer(hre, wallet);
  const artifact = await deployer.loadArtifact("Greeter");

  // Deposit some funds to L2 in order to be able to perform L2 transactions.
  const depositAmount = ethers.utils.parseEther("0.001");
  const depositHandle = await deployer.zkWallet.deposit({
    to: deployer.zkWallet.address,
    token: utils.ETH_ADDRESS,
    amount: depositAmount,
  });
  // Wait until the deposit is processed on zkSync
  await depositHandle.wait();

  // Deploy this contract. The returned object will be of a `Contract` type, similarly to ones in `ethers`.
  // `greeting` is an argument for contract constructor.
  const greeting = "Hi there!";
  const greeterContract = await deployer.deploy(artifact, [greeting]);

  // Show the contract info.
  const contractAddress = greeterContract.address;
  console.log(`${artifact.contractName} was deployed to ${contractAddress}`);
}
```

7. After replacing the `WALLET-PRIVATE-KEY` text with the `0x`-prefixed private key of the Ethereum wallet, run the script using the following command:

```
yarn hardhat deploy-zksync
```

In the output, you should see the address where the contract was deployed to.

### Paying for deployment in ERC20 tokens

This section is optional, and is used for learning how to pay for deployments of smart contracts in ERC20 tokens. To go straight to the front-end integration, click [here](#front-end-integration).

::: tip Note on L2 token address

Note that on the zkSync network, addresses of ERC-20 tokens are different from their addresses on Ethereum. So if, for example, you deposit an ERC-20 token to zkSync, the token address will not be the same as on Ethereum.
To get the address of an ERC-20 token on L2, call the `getL2TokenAddress()` method from the `Provider` / `Wallet` class:

:::

```typescript
const L2_USDC_ADDRESS = await provider.l2TokenAddress(L1_USDC_ADDRESS);
```

1. Import `Provider` from the zksync-web3 library:

```typescript
import { Provider } from "zksync-web3";
```

2. For example, to pay fees in the `USDC` token:

```typescript
const L1_USDC_ADDRESS = "0xd35cceead182dcee0f148ebac9447da2c4d449c4";
const L2_USDC_ADDRESS = await provider.l2TokenAddress(L1_USDC_ADDRESS);
const USDC_DECIMALS = 6;
const deploymentFee = await deployer.estimateDeployFee(artifact, [greeting], L2_USDC_ADDRESS);
// Deposit funds to L2.
const depositHandle = await deployer.zkWallet.deposit({
  to: deployer.zkWallet.address,
  token: L1_USDC_ADDRESS,
  // We deposit more than the minimal required amount to have funds
  // for further iteraction with our smart contract.
  amount: deploymentFee.mul(2),
  // Unlike ETH, ERC20 tokens require approval in order to deposit to zkSync.
  // You can either set the approval in a separate transaction or provide `approveERC20` flag equal to `true`
  // and the SDK will initiate approval transaction under the hood.
  approveERC20: true,
});

// Wait until the deposit is processed by zkSync.
await depositHandle.wait();
```

3. The output of the fee can then be produced in a human-readable format:

```typescript
const parsedFee = ethers.utils.formatUnits(deploymentFee.toString(), USDC_DECIMALS);
console.log(`The deployment will cost ${parsedFee} USDC`);
```

Please note that the fees on the testnet do not correctly represent the fees on the future mainnet release.

4. `USDC` must then be passed as the `feeToken` to the deployment transaction:

```typescript
const greeterContract = await deployer.deploy(artifact, [greeting], L2_USDC_ADDRESS);
```

5. To pay fees in USDC for smart contract interaction, supply the fee token in the `customData` override:

```typescript
const setNewGreetingHandle = await greeterContract.setGreeting(newGreeting, {
  customData: {
    feeToken: L2_USDC_ADDRESS,
  },
});
```

#### Full example:

```typescript
import { Wallet, Provider } from "zksync-web3";
import * as ethers from "ethers";
import { HardhatRuntimeEnvironment } from "hardhat/types";
import { Deployer } from "@matterlabs/hardhat-zksync-deploy";

const L1_USDC_ADDRESS = "0xd35cceead182dcee0f148ebac9447da2c4d449c4";
const USDC_DECIMALS = 6;

// An example of a deploy script that will deploy and call a simple contract.
export default async function (hre: HardhatRuntimeEnvironment) {
  console.log(`Running deploy script for the Greeter contract`);

  // Initialize the wallet.
  const provider = new Provider(hre.userConfig.zkSyncDeploy?.zkSyncNetwork);
  const wallet = new Wallet("<WALLET-PRIVATE-KEY>");
  
  // Deriving L2 token address from L1 token address.
  const L2_USDC_ADDRESS = await provider.l2TokenAddress(L1_USDC_ADDRESS);

  // Create deployer object and load the artifact of the contract we want to deploy.
  const deployer = new Deployer(hre, wallet);
  const artifact = await deployer.loadArtifact("Greeter");

  // Estimate contract deployment fee
  const greeting = "Hi there!";
  const deploymentFee = await deployer.estimateDeployFee(artifact, [greeting], L2_USDC_ADDRESS);

  // Deposit funds to L2
  const depositHandle = await deployer.zkWallet.deposit({
    to: deployer.zkWallet.address,
    token: L1_USDC_ADDRESS,
    amount: deploymentFee.mul(2),
    approveERC20: true,
  });
  // Wait until the deposit is processed on zkSync
  await depositHandle.wait();

  // Deploy this contract. The returned object will be of a `Contract` type, similarly to ones in `ethers`.
  // `greeting` is an argument for contract constructor.
  const parsedFee = ethers.utils.formatUnits(deploymentFee.toString(), USDC_DECIMALS);
  console.log(`The deployment will cost ${parsedFee} USDC`);

  const greeterContract = await deployer.deploy(artifact, [greeting], { feeToken: L2_USDC_ADDRESS });

  // Show the contract info.
  const contractAddress = greeterContract.address;
  console.log(`${artifact.contractName} was deployed to ${contractAddress}`);
}
```

## Front-end integration

### Setting up the project

In this tutorial, `Vue` will be used as the web framework of choice, but the process will be quite similar regardless of the framework used. To focus on the specifics of using the `zksync-web3` SDK, a template is supplied with all the front-end work done. The final step is to interact with zkSync smart contract.

1. Clone it:

```
git clone https://github.com/matter-labs/greeter-tutorial-starter
```

2. Spin up the project:

```
cd greeter-tutorial-starter
yarn
yarn serve
```

By default, the page should be running at `http://localhost:8080`. Open this URL in the browser to see the page.

### Connecting to Metamask & bridging tokens to zkSync

In order to interact with dApps built on zkSync, connect the Metamask wallet to the zkSync alpha testnet network and bridge some funds to L2.

- The [guide](../testnet/metamask.md) on connecting to Metamask.
- Use our [portal](https://portal.zksync.io) to bridge funds to zkSync.

### Project structure

All the code will be written in the `./src/App.vue`. All the front-end code has been completed; the only task left is to fill out the TODO-s regarding interaction with zkSync:

```javascript
initializeProviderAndSigner() {
  // TODO: initialize provider and signer based on `window.ethereum`
},

async getGreeting() {
  // TODO: return the current greeting
  return "";
},

async getFee() {
  // TOOD: return formatted fee
  return "";
},

async getBalance() {
  // Return formatted balance
  return "";
},

async changeGreeting() {
  this.txStatus = 1;
  try {
    // TODO: Submit the transaction
    this.txStatus = 2;
    // TODO: Wait for transaction compilation
    this.txStatus = 3;
    // Update greeting
    this.greeting = await this.getGreeting();
    this.retreivingFee = true;
    this.retreivingBalance = true;
    // Update balance and fee
    this.currentBalance = await this.getBalance();
    this.currentFee = await this.getFee();
  } catch (e) {
    alert(JSON.stringify(e));
  }
  this.txStatus = 0;
  this.retreivingFee = false;
  this.retreivingBalance = false;
},
```

On the top of the `<script>` tag, you may see the parts that should be filled with the address of the deployed `Greeter` contract and the path to its ABI. Let's fill these fields in the following sections.

```javascript
// eslint-disable-next-line
const GREETER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = ""; // TODO: insert the Greeter contract address here
// eslint-disable-next-line
const GREETER_CONTRACT_ABI = []; // TODO: insert the path to the Greeter contract ABI here
```

Add imports above these constants. The header of the `<script>` tag will appear as the following:

```javascript
import {} from "zksync-web3";
import {} from "ethers";

// eslint-disable-next-line
const GREETER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = ""; // TODO: insert the Greeter contract address here
// eslint-disable-next-line
const GREETER_CONTRACT_ABI = []; // TODO: insert the path to the Greeter contract ABI here
```

### Installing `zksync-web3`

Run the following commands to install `zksync-web3` and `ethers`:

```
yarn add ethers zksync-web3
```

### Getting the ABI and contract address

Open `./src/App.vue` and set the `GREETER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` constant equal to the address where the greeter contract was deployed.

To interact with zkSync's smart contract, its ABI is also needed.

- Create the `./src/abi.json` file.
- You can get the contract's ABI in the hardhat project folder from the previous section in the `./artifacts/contracts/tmp/Flattened.sol/Greeter.json` file. You should copy the `abi` array and paste it into the `abi.json` created in the previous step. The file should look roughly the following way:

```json
[
  {
    "inputs": [
      {
        "internalType": "string",
        "name": "_greeting",
        "type": "string"
      }
    ],
    "stateMutability": "nonpayable",
    "type": "constructor"
  },
  {
    "inputs": [],
    "name": "greet",
    "outputs": [
      {
        "internalType": "string",
        "name": "",
        "type": "string"
      }
    ],
    "stateMutability": "view",
    "type": "function"
  },
  {
    "inputs": [
      {
        "internalType": "string",
        "name": "_greeting",
        "type": "string"
      }
    ],
    "name": "setGreeting",
    "outputs": [],
    "stateMutability": "nonpayable",
    "type": "function"
  }
]
```

Set the `GREETER_CONTRACT_ABI` to require the ABI file.

```js
// eslint-disable-next-line
const GREETER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "0x...";
// eslint-disable-next-line
const GREETER_CONTRACT_ABI = require("./abi.json");
```

### Working with provider

1. Go to the `initializeProviderAndSigner` method in `./src/App.vue`. This method is called after the connection to Metamask is successful.

In this method we should:

- Initialize `Web3Provider` and `Signer` objects for interacting with zkSync.
- Initialize `Contract` object to interact with the `Greeter` contract.

2. Add the necessary dependencies:

```javascript
import { Contract, Web3Provider, Provider } from "zksync-web3";
```

3. The two steps can be done the following way:

```javascript
initializeProviderAndSigner() {
    this.provider = new Provider('https://zksync2-testnet.zksync.dev');
    // Note that we still need to get the Metamask signer
    this.signer = (new Web3Provider(window.ethereum)).getSigner();
    this.contract = new Contract(
        GREETER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
        GREETER_CONTRACT_ABI,
        this.signer
    );
},
```

### Retrieving the greeting

1. Fill in the method retrieving the greeting from smart contract:

```javascript
async getGreeting() {
    // Smart contract calls work the same way as in `ethers`
    return await this.contract.greet();
}
```

The full methods now look the following way:

```javascript
initializeProviderAndSigner() {
    this.provider = new Provider('https://zksync2-testnet.zksync.dev');
    // Note that we still need to get the Metamask signer
    this.signer = (new Web3Provider(window.ethereum)).getSigner();
    this.contract = new Contract(
        GREETER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
        GREETER_CONTRACT_ABI,
        this.signer
    );
},
async getGreeting() {
    return await this.contract.greet();
},
```

After connecting the Metamask wallet, the following page should be viewable:

![img](/start-1.png)

The chosen token to pay the fee can now be selected. However, no balances are updated, _yet_.

### Retrieving token balance and transaction fee

The easiest way to retrieve the user's balance is to use the `Signer.getBalance` method.

1. Add the necessary dependencies:

```javascript
// `ethers` is only used in this tutorial for its utility functions
import { ethers } from "ethers";
```

2. Implement the method itself:

```javascript
async getBalance() {
    // Getting the balance for the signer in the selected token
    const balanceInUnits = await this.signer.getBalance(this.selectedToken.l2Address);
    // To display the number of tokens in the human-readable format, we need to format them,
    // e.g. if balanceInUnits returns 500000000000000000 wei of ETH, we want to display 0.5 ETH the user
    return ethers.utils.formatUnits(balanceInUnits, this.selectedToken.decimals);
},
```

3. Estimate the fee:

```javascript
async getFee() {
    // Getting the amount of gas (ergs) needed for one transaction
    const feeInGas = await this.contract.estimateGas.setGreeting(this.newGreeting);
    // Getting the gas price per one erg. For now, it is the same for all tokens.
    const gasPriceInUnits = await this.provider.getGasPrice();

    // To display the number of tokens in the human-readable format, we need to format them,
    // e.g. if feeInGas*gasPriceInUnits returns 500000000000000000 wei of ETH, we want to display 0.5 ETH the user
    return ethers.utils.formatUnits(feeInGas.mul(gasPriceInUnits), this.selectedToken.decimals);
},
```

When opening the page and select the token to pay fee with, the balance and the expected fee for the transaction will be available.

The `Refresh` button should be used to recalculate the fee, as the fee may depend on the length of the string to be set.

It is possible to also click on the `Change greeting` button, but nothing will be changed as the contract has not been called yet.

![img](/start-2.png)

### Updating the greeting

1. Interacting with smart contract works absolutely the same way as in `ethers`, however, the `customData` override is required to supply the `feeToken` of the transaction:

```javascript
const txHandle = await this.contract.setGreeting(this.newGreeting, {
  customData: {
    // Passing the token to pay fee with
    feeToken: this.selectedToken.l2Address,
  },
});
```

2. Wait until the transaction is committed:

```javascript
await txHandle.wait();
```

The full method looks the following way:

```javascript
async changeGreeting() {
    this.txStatus = 1;
    try {
        const txHandle = await this.contract.setGreeting(this.newGreeting, {
            customData: {
                // Passing the token to pay fee with
                feeToken: this.selectedToken.l2Address
            }
        });
        this.txStatus = 2;

        // Wait until the transaction is committed
        await txHandle.wait();
        this.txStatus = 3;

        // Update greeting
        this.greeting = await this.getGreeting();

        this.retreivingFee = true;
        this.retreivingBalance = true;
        // Update balance and fee
        this.currentBalance = await this.getBalance();
        this.currentFee = await this.getFee();
    } catch (e) {
        alert(JSON.stringify(e));
    }

    this.txStatus = 0;
    this.retreivingFee = false;
    this.retreivingBalance = false;
},
```

### Complete app

The greeting should now be updatable.

1. Type the new greeting in the input box and click on the `Change greeting` button:

![img](/start-3.png)

2. Since the `feeToken` was supplied, the transaction to be sent is of the `EIP712` type:

![img](/start-4.png)

3. Click "Sign".

After the transaction is processed, the page updates the balances and the new greeting can be viewed:
