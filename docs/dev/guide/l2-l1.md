# L2 -> L1 communication

This section describes the interface for interaction with Ethereum from L2. It assumes that you are already familiar with the basic concepts of working with the L2 -> L1 communication. If you are new to this topic, you can read the conceptual introduction [here](../zksync-v2/l1-l2-interop.md). 

## Structure

Unlike the L1 -> L2 communication, it is impossible to directly initialize transactions from L2 to L1. However, you can send an arbitrary-length message from zkSync to Ethereum and then handle the received message on L1 smart contract. From the L2 side, to send a message special system contract should be called. It accepts only bytes of the message that will be sent to the Ethereum `zkSync` smart contract. From the L1 side, the `zkSync` smart contract provides an interface to prove that message was sent to L1 in a certain zkSync block. 

## Sending a message on L2

::: sender of the message will be determined from context (i.e. `msg.sender`)

```
function sendToL1(bytes memory _message) external returns (bytes32 messageHash);
```

- `_message` is a parameter that contains raw bytes of the message

The function sends a message from L2 and returns the keccak256 hash of the message bytes. The hash of the message can be used later for getting proof that the message was sent on L1. But its use is not optional and is for convenience purposes only.
