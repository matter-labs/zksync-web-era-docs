# L2 -> L1 communication

This section describes the interface for interaction with Ethereum from L2. It assumes that you are already familiar with the basic concepts of working with the L2 -> L1 communication. If you are new to this topic, you can read the conceptual introduction [here](../zksync-v2/l1-l2-interop.md). 

## Structure

Unlike the L1 -> L2 communication, it is impossible to directly initialize transactions from L2 to L1. However, you can send an arbitrary-length message from zkSync to Ethereum and then handle the received message on L1 smart contract. From the L2 side, to send a message special system contract should be called. It accepts only bytes of the message that will be sent to the zkSync smart contract on Ethereum. From the L1 side, the zkSync smart contract provides an interface to prove that message was sent to L1 in a certain zkSync block. 

## Sending a message on L2

::: sender of the message will be determined from context (i.e. `msg.sender`)

```
function sendToL1(bytes memory _message) external returns (bytes32 messageHash);
```

- `_message` is a parameter that contains raw bytes of the message

The function sends a message from L2 and returns the keccak256 hash of the message bytes. The hash of the message can be used later for getting proof that the message was sent on L1. But its use is optional and is for convenience purposes only.

### Examples

#### Solidity

```sol
//SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicense
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

// Importing interfaces and addresses of the system contracts
import "@matterlabs/zksync-contracts/l2/system-contracts/Constants.sol";

contract Example {
    function sendMessageToL1() external returns(bytes32 messageHash) {
        // Construct the message directly on the contract
        bytes memory message = abi.encode(address(this));
        
        messageHash = L1_MESSENGER_CONTRACT.sendToL1(message);
    }
}
```

## Prove inclusion of the message into the L2 block

```
    struct L2Message {
        address sender;
        bytes data;
    }

    function proveL2MessageInclusion(
        uint32 _blockNumber,
        uint256 _index,
        L2Message calldata _message,
        bytes32[] calldata _proof
    ) external view returns (bool);
```

- `_blockNumber` is a parameter that points to the **L2** block number in which the message was sent.
- `_index` is a parameter that contains the serial number of the message in L2 block. Can be restored both from observing Ethereum and received via API.
- `_message` is a parameter that contains full information of the sent message, including raw bytes of payload and sender address.
- `_proof` is a parameter that contains Merkle proof of the message inclusion. Can be restored both from observing Ethereum and received via API.

The function returns a boolean value whose value indicates the success of proving that message with such parameters was sent to L1.

#### Solidity

```sol
//SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicense
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

// Importing zkSync contract interface
import "@matterlabs/zksync-contracts/l1/contracts/zksync/interfaces/IZkSync.sol";

contract Example {
    // NOTE: zkSync contract implements only the functionality of proving that a message belongs to a block
    // but does not guarantee that such a proof was used only once. That's why contract that uses L1 -> L1 // communication must take care of the double handling the message.
    /// @dev mapping L2 block number => message number => flag
    /// @dev Used to indicated that zkSync L2 -> L1 message was already processed
    mapping(uint32 => mapping(uint256 => bool)) isL2ToL1MessageProcessed;

    function consumeMessageFromL2(
        // The address of the zkSync smart contract.
        // It is not recommended to hardcode it during the alpha testnet as regenesis may happen.
        address _zkSyncAddress,
        // zkSync block number in which the message was sent
        uint32 _l2BlockNumber,
        // Message index, that can be received via API
        uint256 _index,
        // The message that was sent from l2
        bytes calldata _message,
        // Merkle proof for the message
        bytes32[] calldata _proof,
        ) external returns(bytes32 messageHash) {
            // check that the message has not been processed yet
            require(!isL2ToL1MessageProcessed(_l2BlockNumber, _index));

            IZkSync zksync = IZkSync(_zkSyncAddress);
            L2Message message = L2Message({
                sender: 0x19a5bfcbe15f98aa073b9f81b58466521479df8d,
                data: _message,  
            });

            bool success = zksync.proveL2MessageInclusion(_l2BlockNumber, _index, message, _proof);
            require(success, "Failed to prove message inclusion");

            // Mark message as processed
            isL2ToL1MessageProcessed(_l2BlockNumber, _index) = true;
    }
}
