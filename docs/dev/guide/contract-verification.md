# Contract Verification

## What is contract verification?

When you deploy a smart contract on a network, youâ€™re essentially deploying the bytecode produced by the Solidity compiler.

Contract verification is ensuring the correctness, security, and safety of the smart contract implementations which allows smart contract developers to prove and publish the source code of the contracts deployed on-chain.

## How are smart contracts verified in zkSync?

The deployed bytecode and the solidity source code of a smart contract are compared during the verification process using zkSync. The algorithm compiles the source code to compare the generated bytecode to the deployed one.
<br>
If the two sides match in every way, the contract is verified.

Code verification requires six arguments: 

- The compiler address
- The contract name
- The source code, including the source of all imports
- The version of the compiler used to produce the deployed bytecode
- Information about the number of compiler optimizations (if any)
- The constructor arguments
 
 If any of these pieces of information is wrong, the process of verification fails.

## Modes of verification

Depending on whether your contract is deployed on a network or with zkSync, there are two modes of contract verification:

- Public: Every zkSync user on the block explorer will be able to check the verified source code and interact with it. 
- Private: The contract is verified and thus valid within a single project in zkSync, available to you and anybody with access to the project.



## Verifying Contracts Using the zkSync Block Explorer

You can verify your contract so that zkSync can convert it all into a format that is readable by everyone. It is beneficial if you want to make the most of our zkEVM Debugger capabilities.

To get started click the **Tools** tab in the top header, a dropdown will pop up and select **Smart Contract Verification**,  after which you will be shown the following screen:

### Enter contract details

To verify the contract, enter the following details;

- Contract address: The address provided must match with `0x` address supplied during contract creation.
- Contract name: The name must be identical to the name provided in the contract.
- Optimization: This checks whether or not optimization was used while compiling the contract, If you enabled optimization during compilation, check **Yes** otherwise select **No**
- Compiler version: This specifies the exact version of the compiler used to compile a smart contract. Click on the dropdown to specify the compiler version used.

- Enter the Solidity Contract code: Copy the code from your editor and paste in the text area.
<br>
**Note:** You may need to flatten your solidity code if it utilizes a library or inherits dependencies from another contract. 
<br> 
We recommend using the [truffle flattener](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/truffle-flattener) or the [POA solidity flattener](https://github.com/poanetwork/solidity-flattener).

- Constructor arguments: If Constructor Arguments are required by the contract, you should add them here, but in [ABI hex encoded form](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/abi-spec.html).
  
<br>

**Note:** To obtain the Constructor arguments, after deploying your contract, include this 
<br>

```
console.log("constructor args:" + greeterContract.interface.encodeDeploy([greeting]));

``` 

For example;

```typescript
// Deploy this contract. 
// `greeting` is an argument for contract constructor.

const greeting = "Hi there!";
const greeterContract = await deployer.deploy(artifact, [greeting]);

//obtain the Constructor Arguments
console.log("constructor args:" + greeterContract.interface.encodeDeploy([greeting]));
```

- Lastly, click the **Verify Smart Contract** button.
<br>
If all goes well, you will see a success message.
