# Glossary

This section contains a comprehensive list of terms associated to zkSync and it's related ecosystem.

## A

### account

An object containing an address, balance, nonce, and optional storage and code. An account can be a contract account or an externally owned account (EOA).

### application programming interface (API)

An Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of definitions for how to use a piece of software. An API sits between an application and a web server, and facilitates the transfer of data between them.



## B

### blocks

A block is a bundled unit of information that include an ordered list of transactions and consensus-related information. 

## C

### contract account

An account containing code that executes whenever it receives a transaction from another account (EOA or contract).


## D

### Dapp

A dapp is a web application that is built on top of open, decentralized, peer-to-peer infrastructure services.

## E

### ether

The native cryptocurrency used by the Ethereum ecosystem, which covers gas costs when executing transactions.

## F

### finality

Finality is the guarantee that a set of transactions before a given time will not change and can't be reverted.

## G

### gas

A virtual fee used in Ethereum to execute smart contracts.

### gas price

Price in ether of one unit of gas specified in a transaction.

## H

### hash 

A fixed-length fingerprint of variable-size input, produced by a hash function.

## I

### internal transaction

A transaction sent from a contract account to another contract account.

## K

### keccak-256

Cryptographic hash function used in Ethereum. Keccak-256 was standardized as SHA-3.

## L

### layer 2

An overlaying application or network that operates on top of Ethereum protocol. 

## M

### mainnet

Mainnet is blockchain protocol that is fully developed and deployed, with real value.

### mint

 Minting is the process of creating new tokens and bringing them into circulation so that they can be used.

## N

### nonce

A random number used once to iterate the output hash calculations.

<!-- ## O

## P -->

### private chain

A fully private blockchain is one with authorized access, not publicly available for use.

## S

### signing

Demonstrating cryptographically that a transaction was approved by the holder of a specific private key.

## T

### testnet

A network used to simulate the behavior of a [mainnet](#mainnet) blockchain network.

### token

A virtual currency or a denomination of a cryptocurrency. It represents a tradable asset or utility that resides on its own blockchain and allows the holder to use it for investment or economic purposes.

## V

### validator

A node in a proof-of-stake system responsible for storing data, processing transactions, and adding new blocks to the blockchain. 

## W

### wei

The smallest denomination of [ether](#ether).

## Z

### zero-knowledge proof (zk proof)

A zero-knowledge proof is a cryptographic method that allows you prove the truth of a statement without sharing the statement's contents or revealing how you discovered the truth.
