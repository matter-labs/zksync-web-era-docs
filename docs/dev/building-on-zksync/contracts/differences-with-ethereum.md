# Differences with Ethereum

zkSync Era can handle almost all smart contracts based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and maintains high security standards, reducing the need for repeated security audits. However, it's important to be aware of the following differences.

## Differences

### Use `call` over `send`/`transfer`

Avoid using `payable(X).send`/`payable(X).transfer` because the 2300 gas stipend may not be enough to send a transfer, especially if it involves state changes that require a large amount of L2 gas for data. Instead, we recommend using `call`.

Instead of:

```solidity
payable(X).send // or
payable(X).transfer
```

Use instead:

```solidity
(bool s, )= call{value: x}("")
```

This converts the `send`/`transfer` functionality to `call` and [avoids potential security risks outlined here.](https://consensys.net/diligence/blog/2019/09/stop-using-soliditys-transfer-now/)

### Non-standard `CREATE`/`CREATE2` behaviour

On Ethereum, both `CREATE` and `CREATE2` accept the `initCode` of the contract plus concatenated constructor parameters as input. However, on zkSync, contract deployment is done via hashes, and the `factoryDeps` field of EIP712 transactions contain the bytecode. The actual deployment is done by providing the contract’s hash to the `ContractDeployer` system contract.

To ensure that `create`/`create2` works correctly, the compiler must know the bytecode of the deployed contract beforehand. The compiler interprets the `calldata` arguments as incomplete to  `ContractDeployer` (the rest is filled with the compiler internally). The `datasize`/ `dataoffset` Yul instructions were adapted to return a constant size and the bytecode hash instead of bytecode.

Consider the following code:

```solidity
MyContract a = new MyContract();
MyContract a = new MyContract{salt: ...}();
```

The above should work as expected. 

Additionally, the following code should also work, but must be explicitly tested to ensure it works as intended:

```solidity
bytes memory bytecode = type(MyContract).creationCode;
assembly {
    addr := create2(0, add(bytecode, 32), mload(bytecode), salt)
} 
```

The following code will not work because the compiler is unaware of the bytecode beforehand.

```solidity
function myFactory(bytes memory bytecode) public {
   assembly {
      addr := create(0, add(bytecode, 0x20), mload(bytecode))
   }
}
```

Unfortunately, it is not possible to distinguish between the above cases at compile-time. Therefore, we highly recommended including tests for any factory that deploys child contracts.

For zkEVM bytecode, we use a different address derivation from Ethereum. The exact formulas are available in our SDK, as seen here:

```typescript
export function create2Address(sender: Address, bytecodeHash: BytesLike, salt: BytesLike, input: BytesLike) {
    const prefix = ethers.utils.keccak256(ethers.utils.toUtf8Bytes('zksyncCreate2'));
    const inputHash = ethers.utils.keccak256(input);
    const addressBytes = ethers.utils
        .keccak256(ethers.utils.concat([prefix, ethers.utils.zeroPad(sender, 32), salt, bytecodeHash, inputHash]))
        .slice(26);
    return ethers.utils.getAddress(addressBytes);
}

export function createAddress(sender: Address, senderNonce: BigNumberish) {
    const prefix = ethers.utils.keccak256(ethers.utils.toUtf8Bytes('zksyncCreate'));
    const addressBytes = ethers.utils
        .keccak256(
            ethers.utils.concat([
                prefix,
                ethers.utils.zeroPad(sender, 32),
                ethers.utils.zeroPad(ethers.utils.hexlify(senderNonce), 32)
            ])
        )
        .slice(26);

    return ethers.utils.getAddress(addressBytes);
}
```

### Differences in `block.timestamp` and `block.number`

For more information on blocks in zkSync Era, including the differences between `block.timestamp` and `block.number`, check out the [blocks in zkSync Era documentation](../../developer-guides/transactions/blocks.md#blocks-in-zksync-era).

### Differences in `COINBASE` `DIFFICULTY` `BASEFEE` 
In zkSync Era, there are some differences in the behavior of certain variables on L2 compared to L1.

- The `COINBASE` variable in zkSync Era returns the address of the `Bootloader` contract, which is `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000008001`.

- The `DIFFICULTY` variable returns a constant value of `2500000000000000`.

- The `BASEFEE` variable is not a constant in zkSync Era and is instead defined by the fee model. Usually, it is set to 0.25 gwei, but it can increase under very high L1 gas prices.

### Use of `codesize`/`codecopy` and `calldata` in the deploy code

On zkEVM, the behavior of `calldata` and `codesize`/`codecopy` instructions in the constructor is different compared to EVM. In zkEVM, `calldata` contains constructor arguments, while in EVM, `calldata` is empty during constructor execution.

In addition, `codesize` instruction behaves similarly to `calldatasize`, and `codecopy` instruction behaves similarly to `calldatacopy`. To make `codesize` and `codecopy` work, set the datasize of the current object to 0.

### Using `return` in the deploy code does not function as intended

On zkSync Era, constructors return immutable arrays and cannot be used to return other data types. If you try to use the `return` keyword in a constructor, it returns the array of immutables in the auxiliary heap - that was previously written there using `setimmutable` - instead of the data you specified. Therefore, using `return` in the deploy code will not function as intended.

### Yul users only: `datasize`, `dataoffset`, `datacopy`, `setimmutable`, and `loadimmutable` may behave differently

On zkSync Era, there may be differences in behavior when using certain Yul instructions such as `datasize`, `dataoffset`, `datacopy`, `setimmutable`, and `loadimmutable`. These differences typically occur when using solc-generated Yul code with the system's create and constructors.

These modifications were made to ensure compatibility with the zkSync Era system, and they may not behave the same way as they would on the Ethereum network. It is important to keep this in mind when writing Yul code for zkSync Era.

### Modified opcodes

#### `mstore`/`mload`

Unlike EVM, where the memory growth is counted in words, on zkEVM the memory growth is counted in bytes. For example, if you write `mstore(100, 0)` the `msize` on zkEVM will be `132`, but on the EVM is will be `160`. Note that, unlike EVM which has quadratic growth for memory payments, on zkEVM the fees are charged linearly at a rate of `1` erg per byte.

Also, the compiler sometimes optimizes unused memory reads/writes. This can lead to different `msize` compared to Ethereum (since fewer bytes have been allocated), leading to cases where EVM panics. However, zkEVM doesn't behave the same here due to the difference in memory growth.

#### `calldataload`/`calldatacopy`

If the `offset` for the `calldataload(offset)` is greater than `2^32-33` then execution panics. On Ethereum, the returned value is `0`.

Internally, the `calldatacopy(to, offset, len)` on zkEVM is just a loop with the `calldataload` and `mstore` on each iteration. That means, that if `2^32-32 + offset%32 < offset + len` the code execution panics. Note that this case affects only big numbers (`offset + len > 2^32-32`), for smaller numbers everything works as on the EVM.

#### `call`/`staticcall`/`delegatecall`

For `call`, you can specify a memory slice to write the returndata to (the `out` and `outsize` arguments for `call(g, a, v, in, insize, out, outsize)`).

On EVM, if `outsize != 0` the allocated memory grows to `out + outsize` (rounded up to the words) regardless of the `returndatasize`. On zkEVM, `returndatacopy`, similarly to `calldatacopy`, is implemented as a cycle iterating over `returndata` with a few additional checks specific to `returndata` (i.e. panic if `offset + len > returndatasize` to simulate the same behaviour as on EVM).

So, unlike EVM where the memory growth happens before the call itself, on zkEVM the necessary copying of the returndata happens only after the call has ended, leading to a difference in `msize()`, and sometimes zkEVM not panicking where the EVM would panic due to the difference in memory growth.

## Recommendations

### It is better to use a proxy pattern at the early stage of the protocol

zkSync Era is based on the special zk-friendly VM. That’s why we provide our compiler that compiles standard Solidity code to the zkEVM bytecode. 

While we have extensive test coverage to ensure EVM compatibility, some issues may still be found after the mainnet release. We will implement the patches for these in a timely manner. 

In order to apply a fix of a compiler bug, you need to upgrade your smart contract. That’s why we advise using the Proxy pattern for a few months after your first deployment on zkSync Era, even if you plan to migrate to the immutable contract later on (which can done by migrating the governance to 0 address in the future).

### Your protocol should not rely on EVM gas logic

zkSync Era has a distinctive gas logic compared to Ethereum. There are two main drivers:

- We have a state-diff-based data availability, which means that the price for the execution depends on the L1 gas price.
- zkEVM has a different set of computational trade-offs compared to the standard computational model. In practice, this means that the price for opcodes is different from Ethereum. Also, zkEVM contains a different set of opcodes under the hood and so the “gas” metric of the same set of operations may be different on zkSync Era and on Ethereum.

:::warning
Our fee model is being constantly improved and so it is highly recommended **NOT** to hardcode any constants since the fee model changes in the future might be breaking for this constant.
:::

#### `gasPerPubdataByte` should be taken into account in development

Due to the state diff-based fee model of zkSync Era, every transaction includes a constant called `gasPerPubdataByte`. 

Presently, the operator has control over this value. However, in EIP712 transactions, users also sign an upper bound on this value, but the operator is free to choose any value up to that upper bound. Note, that even if the value is chosen by the protocol, it will still fluctuate based on the L1 gas price. Therefore, relying solely on gas is inadequate.

A notable example is a Gnosis Safe’s `execTransaction` method:

```solidity
// We require some gas to emit the events (at least 2500) after the execution and some to perform code until the execution (500)
// We also include the 1/64 in the check that is not send along with a call to counteract potential shortings because of EIP-150
require(gasleft() >= ((safeTxGas * 64) / 63).max(safeTxGas + 2500) + 500, "GS010");
// Use scope here to limit variable lifetime and prevent `stack too deep` errors
{
    uint256 gasUsed = gasleft();
    // If the gasPrice is 0 we assume that nearly all available gas can be used (it is always more than safeTxGas)
    // We only substract 2500 (compared to the 3000 before) to ensure that the amount passed is still higher than safeTxGas
    success = execute(to, value, data, operation, gasPrice == 0 ? (gasleft() - 2500) : safeTxGas);
    gasUsed = gasUsed.sub(gasleft());
   
    // ...
}
```

While the contract does enforce the correct `gasleft()`, it does not enforce the correct `gasPerPubdata`, since there was no such parameter on Ethereum. This means that a malicious user could call this wallet when the `gasPerPubdata` is high and make the transaction fail, hence making it spend artificially more gas than required. 

This is the case for all relayer-like logic ported directly from Ethereum and so if you see your code relying on logic like “the user should provide at X gas”, then the `gasPerPubdata` should be also taken into account on zkSync Era.  

For now, zkSync Era operators use honest values for ETH L1 price and `gasPerPubdata`, so it should not be an issue if enough margin is added to the estimated gas. In order to prepare for the future decentralization of zkSync Era, it is imperative that you update your contract.

### Native account abstraction over `ecrecover` for validation

Use zkSync Era's native account abstraction support for signature validation instead of this function. 

We recommend not relying on the fact that an account has an ECDSA private key, since the account may be governed by multisig and use another signature scheme.

### Precompiles

Some EVM cryptographic precompiles (notably pairings and RSA) won’t be immediately available. However, pairing is prioritized to allow deployment of both Hyperchains and protocols like Aztec/Dark Forest without modifications.

Ethereum cryptographic primitives like `ecrecover`, `keccak256`, and `sha256` are supported as precompiles. No actions are required from your side as all the calls to the precompiles are done by the compilers under the hood.
