# Smart contract development

zkSync 2.0 allows developers to build projects using the same programming languages and tools used to build on Ethereum.

## Solidity support

For the time being Solidity `>=0.4.10` versions are supported, though **we strongly recommended using** `^0.8.0` as older versions contain known bugs.

Solidity versions `>=0.8` are compiled through Yul, whereas `<=0.7` are compiled via the EVM legacy assembly, which is a less friendly IR due to obfuscation of the control-flow and call graphs. For this reason, there are a few limitations in zkSync for contracts written in Solidity `<=0.7`:

- Contract-local recursion is not supported.
- Internal function pointers are not supported.
- Possible impact on the contract size and VM cycles count.

### Using libraries in Solidity

The usage of libraries in Solidity is supported in zkSync 2.0 with the following considerations:

- If a Solidity library can be inlined (i.e. it only contains `private` or `internal` methods), it can be used without any additional configuration.
- However, if a library contains at least one `public` or `external` method, it's non-inlinable and its address needs to be passed explicitly to the compiler. You can learn more about [how to compile non-inlineable libraries in this section of the docs](../../../api/hardhat/compiling-libraries.md).

## Vyper support

Currently only Vyper `^0.3.3` is supported.

## Compilers

Although you can write smart contracts in both Solidty and Vyper, compiling these contracts to our zkEVM bytecode requires special compilers:

- [zksolc](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksolc-bin): Solidity compiler.
- [zkvyper](https://github.com/matter-labs/zkvyper-bin): Vyper compiler.

**Our compilers are based on LLVM**. LLVM-based compilers have become the industry standard because of their robustness, efficiency, and the large community around the world. They provide us some additional advantages:

- Enable us to improve the efficiency over the original EVM bytecode because with LLVM we can take advantage of the many optimizations and tools available in this mature ecosystem.
- Pave the way for us to add support for integrating codebases written in other programming languages with LLVM front-ends. By doing so, developers can build dApps and use blockchains in ways that are currently not possible.

We recommend using these compilers via [their correspondent Hardhat plugins](../../../api/hardhat/plugins.md) (although they're also available as binaries). These plugins should be added to the Hardhat's config file and allow developers to compile new projects or migrate existing ones to zkSync 2.0.

::: warning

Compilers are no longer released as Docker images and its usage is no longer recommended. Use the `compilerSource: "binary"` in the Hardhat config file to use the binary instead.

## EVM compatibility

Almost every smart contract written for EVM will be supported by zkSync 2.0 and will hold all key security invariants so that no additional security re-auditing will be required in most cases. A notable exception is the contracts that use the following EVM opcodes:

- `SELFDESTRUCT` - It’s considered harmful and was deprecated in [EIP-6049](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6049).
- `CALLCODE` - It was deprecated on Ethereum in [EIP-2488](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2488) in favor of `DELEGATECALL`.
- `EXTCODECOPY` - We've skip it for now because zkEVM opcodes are not identical to EVM ones, but it can be implemented if needed.
- `CODECOPY` - It's replaced with `CALLDATACOPY` in the deploy code.
- `PC` - Not accessible in Yul and Solidity `>=0.7.0`. Accessible in Solidity `0.6.0` although it produces a runtime error.

**All these opcodes produce an error on compilation.**

There are a few other distinctions, for example, gas metering will be different (as is the case for other L2s as well). Some EVM’s cryptographic precompiles (notably pairings and RSA) won’t be available in the very first release but will be implemented soon after the launch, with pairing being a priority to allow both Hyperchains and protocols like Aztec/Dark Forest to be deployed without modifications too.

Ethereum cryptographic primitives like `ecrecover`, `keccak256` and `sha256` are supported as precompiles. No actions are required from your side as all the calls to the precompiles are done by the compilers under the hood.

### Other considerations

- **tx.origin usage:** `tx.origin` is a global variable in Solidity that returns the address of the account that sent the transaction. It's supported on zkSync 2.0, but if a custom account interacts with a contract that uses this, the transactions will fail. We also discourage its usage, as it can pose a threat to a phishing attack that can drain a contract of all funds.

- **ecrecover usage:** If you are using 'ecrecover' to validate a signature of a user account, note that zkSync 2.0 comes with native account abstraction support. It is highly recommended not to rely on the fact that the account has an ECDSA private key attached to it, since they may be ruled by a multisig and use another signature scheme.
