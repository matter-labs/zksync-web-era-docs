# L1 -> L2 communication

This section describes the interface for interaction with zkSync from L1. It assumes that you are already familiar with the basic concepts of working with the priority queue. If you are new to this topic, you can read the conceptual introduction [here](./l1-l2-interop.md#priority-queue). If you want to dive straight into the code, then you can read the cross-chain governance [tutorial](../../tutorials/cross-chain-tutorial.md).

::: warning
- After the system update released in Feb 2023, the `ergs` concept is only used by the VM while the API layer operates with `gas`. 
- For more information, check the [changelog](../../troubleshooting/changelog.md).
:::

## Structure

For the most common usecase, there is "baseFee" for a transaction, which basically means the minimum amount the user has to pay to the operator for him to include this transaction. It is derived based on the `l2gasLimit` for a transaction and the gas price on L1.
In addition, whatever fee the user pays above is called **layer2 tip** and will be used to sort the transactions by the provided L2 fee.

At the moment, all the L1-> L2 transactions are served at the first-in-first-out basis, but in the future we will introduce "priority heap", which will allow for sorting the
transactions.
Basic costs are defined in gas and not in ETH, so the actual amount of ether that the submission of the transaction will cost depends on
the transaction gas price. Generally the flow for calling any of these methods should be the following:

1. Fetch the gas price that you will use to send the transaction.
2. Get the base cost for the transaction.
3. Send the transaction including the needed `value`.

## Using contract interface in your project

To interact with the zkSync mailbox contract using Solidity, you need to use the zkSync contract interface. There are two main ways to get it:

- By importing it from the `@matterlabs/zksync-contracts` npm package (preferred).
- By downloading the contracts from the [repo](https://github.com/matter-labs/v2-testnet-contracts).

The `@matterlabs/zksync-contracts` package can be installed by running the following command:

```
yarn add -D @matterlabs/zksync-contracts
```

In the examples below we assume that the interface is accessed via the `@matterlabs/zksync-contracts` npm package.

### Getting the base cost

The following view function returns the amount of ETH that is needed to be supplied by the user to cover the base cost of the transaction.

```solidity
function l2TransactionBaseCost(
    uint256 _gasPrice,
    uint256 _gasLimit,
    uint256 _l2GasPerPubdataByteLimit
) external view returns (uint256);
```

- `_gasPrice` is a parameter that contains the transaction gas price.
- `_gasLimit` is a parameter that contains the gas limit of the transaction call. You can learn more about gas and the zkSync fee system [here](../transactions/fee-model.md).
- `_l2GasPerPubdataByteLimit` is a parameter that contains the L2 gas price for each published L1 calldata byte. 

### Estimating the gas fee

The RPC function `zks_estimateGasL1ToL2` returns an estimate of how much gas is required to complete the L1->L2 transaction. The parameters are the same as for `eth_estimateGas`. 

`eth_estimateGas` is applicable for both zkSync L2 and Ethereum while `zks_estimateGasL1ToL2` is only available on zkSync.

::: warning
 If the sender is a smart contract, then during the L1->L2 the `msg.sender` address is aliased. Note that this is not done automatically during fee estimation, so it is your responsibility to use the zkSync [`aliasing utility`](#aliasing) to get the correct `from` address for the fee estimation.
:::

The function is wrapped in the [Provider](../../../api/js/providers.md#provider) class.

```ts
async estimateGasL1(transaction: utils.Deferrable<TransactionRequest>): Promise<BigNumber> {
    await this.getNetwork();
      const params = await utils.resolveProperties({
          transaction: this._getTransactionRequest(transaction)
      });
      if (transaction.customData != null) {
          // @ts-ignore
          params.transaction.customData = transaction.customData;
      }
      const result = await this.send('zks_estimateGasL1ToL2', [
          Provider.hexlifyTransaction(params.transaction, { from: true })
      ]);
      try {
          return BigNumber.from(result);
      } catch (error) {
          throw new Error(`bad result from backend (zks_estimateGasL1ToL2): ${result}`);
      }
}
```

You can use the `Provider.estimateGasL1` to estimate the L2 gas needed for the L1->L2 transaction.

The function takes the following parameters:

- `from`: sender address.
- `to`: recipient address.
- `gas`: (optional) gas used for the transaction. 
- `gasPrice`: (optional) gasPrice.
- `value`: (optional) value sent by the transaction.
- `data`: (optional) hash of the method signature and encoded parameters.

### Interface

The following function returns the canonical hash or the requested transaction, that can be used to track the execution of the transaction in L2.

Use the `Provider` class, as described in the [section above](#estimating-the-gas-fee), to call the method.

```solidity
function requestL2Transaction(
    address _contractL2,
    uint256 _l2Value,
    bytes calldata _calldata,
    uint256 _l2GasLimit,
    uint256 _l2GasPerPubdataByteLimit,
    bytes[] calldata _factoryDeps,
    address _refundRecipient
) external payable returns (bytes32 txHash);
```

- `_contractL2` is a parameter that defines the address of the contract to be called.
- `_l2Value` is a parameter that defines the amount of ETH you want to pass with the call to L2. This number will be used as `msg.value` for the transaction.
- `_calldata` is a parameter that contains the calldata of the transaction call. It can be encoded the same way as on Ethereum.
- `_l2GasLimit` is a parameter that contains the gas limit of the transaction call. You can learn more about gas and the zkSync fee system [here](../transactions/fee-model.md).
- `_l2GasPerPubdataByteLimit` is a parameter that contains the L2 gas price per each published to L1 calldata byte.
- `_factoryDeps` is a list of bytecodes. It should contain the bytecode of the contract being deployed. If the contract being deployed is a factory contract, i.e. it can deploy other contracts, the array should also contain the bytecodes of the contracts that can be deployed by it.
- `_refundRecipient` is an address that receives the rest of the fee after the transaction execution. If `refundRecipient == 0`, L2 `msg.sender` is used. 

::: warning
 If the `_refundRecipient` is a smart contract, then during the L1->L2 the `msg.sender` address is [aliased](#aliasing). 
:::

With the method call, some amount of ETH should be supplied to cover the base cost of the transaction (including the `_l2Value`) + layer 2 operator tip.

::: tip
A **successful** L1 -> L2 message produces an `L2Log` with `key = l2TxHash`, and `value = bytes32(1)` whereas a **failed** L1 -> L2 message produces an `L2Log` with `key = l2TxHash`, and `value = bytes32(0)`.
:::

### Aliasing

The L1->L2 alias function applies an alias to a given address. The L2 alias is the same alias that is applied on the L1 smart contracts during L1->L2 communication.

```typescript
export function applyL1ToL2Alias(address: string): string {
    return ethers.utils.hexlify(ethers.BigNumber.from(address).add(L1_TO_L2_ALIAS_OFFSET).mod(ADDRESS_MODULO));
}
```
