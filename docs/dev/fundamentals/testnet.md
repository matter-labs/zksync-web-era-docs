# zkSync Testnet

Welcome to zkSync 2.0 testnet! Our team would be very happy to see what you can build on zkSync. We are glad for any feedback you could provide!

::: warning Alpha testnet

Note, that the system is still in active development, so:

- **Breaking changes are possible in the future.**
- **Some of the updates may require regenesis**, i.e. erasing all the balances, smart contracts, and restarting the blockchain. We will make sure to communicate all regenesis beforehand! Make sure to follow our [Discord](https://discord.gg/px2aR7w).

:::

To get a first-hand impression of the zkSync 2.0 user experience:

- Go to the [zkSync 2.0 Portal](https://portal.zksync.io).
- Get some test tokens from the faucet, or deposit some from Ethereum's GÃ¶rli testnet.
- Make some transfers.

The Portal is the central entry point into the zkSync 2.0 ecosystem for users and developers alike. It contains links to all relevant resources, such as block explorer or the catalog of featured dapps.

## Do I need experience with zkSync 1.x?

Some experience with zkSync 1.x would be helpful to understand some core concepts, e.g. how finality works. From all other aspects, zkSync 2.0 and zkSync 1.x are very different systems, and experience with the latter is not needed to build on zkSync 2.0.

## What do I need to start building?

All the existing SDKs for Ethereum will work out of the box and your users will have the same experience as on Ethereum. If you want to enable advanced zkSync features, like account abstraction, the zkSync SDK should be used.

The only other place where using zkSync SDK is required is during contract deployment. This can be easily done through our hardhat plugin.

## Quickstart on zkSync

Check out our step-by-step [quickstart guide](../developer-guides/hello-world.md), where you will learn:

- How to install zkSync hardhat plugin and deploy smart contracts with it.
- How to build the front-end for your dApp using the `zksync-web3` library.

## Connecting Metamask
