# Interact with zkSync Era

## Do I need experience with zkSync Lite?

Some experience with zkSync Lite would be helpful to understand some core concepts, e.g. how finality works. From all other aspects, zkSync Era and zkSync Lite are very different systems, and experience with the latter is not needed to build on zkSync Era.

## What do I need to start building?

All the existing SDKs for Ethereum will work out of the box and your users will have the same experience as on Ethereum. If you want to enable advanced zkSync features, like account abstraction, the zkSync SDK should be used.

The only other place where using zkSync SDK is required is during contract deployment. This can be easily done through our hardhat plugin.

### Quickstart on zkSync

Check out our step-by-step [quickstart guide](../building-on-zksync/hello-world.md), where you will learn:

- How to install zkSync hardhat plugin and deploy smart contracts with it.
- How to build the front-end for your dApp using the `zksync-web3` library.

<!-- ## Deposit and withdraw funds using zkSync Portal

As the testnet is running on Goerli network, you will need to get some Goerli ETH first. Try any of the faucets below.

- [https://goerli-faucet.mudit.blog/](https://goerli-faucet.mudit.blog/)
- [https://faucets.chain.link/goerli](https://faucets.chain.link/goerli)
- [https://goerli-faucet.slock.it/](https://goerli-faucet.slock.it/)
- [https://goerlifaucet.com/](https://goerlifaucet.com/)

**Step 1**

Head to [https://portal.zksync.io/](https://portal.zksync.io/) and connect your wallet. You will automatically be asked to add the “zkSync Era testnet Goerli” network.

You may also add the network manually to your metamask.

- Network Name: `zkSync mainnet`
- New RPC URL: `https://zksync2-mainnet.zksync.io`
- Chain ID: `324` -->
<!-- 
**Step 2 (Skip if you don’t have Goerli ETH)**

We first go to “Bridge” and then “Deposit” to deposit some \$ETH to zkSync Era.

**Step 3**

Next, we go to “Faucet” to get some testnet $ETH, $LINK, $DAI, $WBTC and \$USDC into our zkSync address.

Check your balance at “Balances” after claiming.

**Step 4**

Now go to “Transfer”. Input the address of another wallet and transfer some tokens to it. Pay the fees in DAI if you don’t have ETH.

**Step 5**

At last we go to “Withdraw” to withdraw some \$DAI from zkSync back to Goerli. Pay the fees in ETH.
