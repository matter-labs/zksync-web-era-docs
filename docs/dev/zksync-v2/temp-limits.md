## Using libraries in Solidity

If a Solidity library can be inlined, i.e. it only contains `private` or `internal` methods, then this library can be used without any limitations.

However, if a library contains at least one `public` or `external` method, it is no longer inlined in the Yul representation. These addresses need to be passed explicitly to our compiler. This is not currently supported by our hardhat plugin, but will be added later.

## Unsupported opcodes

- `SELFDESTRUCT` (itâ€™s considered harmful and there are calls to deactivate it on L1).
- `EXTCODECOPY` (it can be implemented if needed, but we skip it for now because zkEVM opcodes are not identical to EVM ones anyway).
- `CALLCODE` (deprecated on Ethereum in favor of `DELEGATECALL`).

## Temporarily simulated by constant values

These opcodes will be supported by the time of the mainnet launch.

- `block.gaslimit` always returns `2^32-1`.
- `MSIZE` always returns `2^16`.
- `GASLIMIT` (`tx.gasprice`) always returns `0`.
- `ORIGIN` (`tx.origin`) always returns `0`.
- `GASPRICE` (`tx.gasprice`) always returns `0`.
- `CHAINID` (`chain_id`) always returns `0`.
- `BLOCKHASH` (`tx.blockhash`) always returns `0`.
- `COINBASE` (`block.coinbase`) always returns `0`.

## Ignored by the compiler

- `DIFFICULTY` (`block.difficulty`) always returns `0` (zkSync does not have proof of work consensus).
- `PC` always returns `0` (we can technically support it, but most likely its use-cases are very specific for the EVM, so to avoid confusion it was decided not to).
