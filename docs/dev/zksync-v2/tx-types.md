# Transaction types

zkSync supports Ethereum's "legacy" (pre-EIP2718) transaction types and its custom EIP712 transactions. You can use transactions of this type to pay fees in ERC20 tokens. Additionally, it is only possible to deploy smart contracts with this type of transaction.

Knowing the details about the transaction format is not required to use zkSync's SDK, but if you are curious, you can read more about it [here](../../api/api.md#eip712).
