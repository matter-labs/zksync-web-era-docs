# Transaction types

zkSync supports Ethereum's "legacy" (pre-EIP2718) transaction types, EIP1559 transaction type, and its custom EIP712 transactions. You can use transactions of this type to use zkSync-specific features like account abstraction. Additionally, it is only possible to deploy smart contracts with this type of transaction.

Knowing the details about the transaction format is not required to use zkSync's SDK, but if you are curious, you can read more about it [here](../../api/api.md#eip712).
