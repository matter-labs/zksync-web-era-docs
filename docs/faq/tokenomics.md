# Tokenomics

[[toc]]

## What is Matter Labs' business model?

Currently, the service operates as close as possible to break-even costs and will remain so until the system becomes
decentralized. To safely compensate for the expenses, from time to time zkSync adjusts its fees to keep up with the gas
price changes. This the reason why, for example, you can see zkSync fees getting slightly higher (respectively lower)
when the gas prices on the mainnet increase (resp. decrease). Note that zkSync transfer fees always remain over 20 times
cheaper for ETH (and nearly 100 times cheaper for ERC20 tokens) than the ones on the mainnet.

### Will zkSync have a native token?

Yes.

### When? How can I get the token?

Our efforts and focus have been so far dedicated for the development of zkSync and its security. Any announcements from zkSync can be found on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/px2aR7w), [Telegram](https://t.me/zksync), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zksync).

### How will it work?

When zkSync becomes
[fully decentralized](/faq/decentralization.md#how-decentralized-is-zksync), the token will be used for staking in order
to become a validator in the zkSync network. More details to come.
