# Fee Withdrawer

[The Fee Withdrawer](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-fee-withdrawer) automates the withdrawal of the hyperchain collected fees to an address on the base layer.

This helps ensure the ETH operator on the base layer side has a constant influx of the gas token to keep working properly.
