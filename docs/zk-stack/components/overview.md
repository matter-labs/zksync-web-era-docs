# Overview

ZK Stack is a modular framework for building sovereign ZK-powered Ethereum rollups (called hyperchains); it is a modular, open-source framework that is both free and designed to build custom hyperchains (ZK-powered L2s and L3s), based on the code of zkSync Era, the first hyperchain.

At its core, the ZK Stack offers two key features: sovereignty and seamless connectivity. The creator (you) possesses full rights to the code and enjoys unrestricted autonomy to customize and shape many aspects of your chain. Hyperchains operate independently but are interconnected by a network of hyperbridges, enabling trustless, fast (within minutes), and cheap (cost of a single transaction) interoperability.
