# Portal + Bridge

[The Portal](https://github.com/matter-labs/dapp-portal) is a dApp that allows you (and your users) to easily interact with your hyperchain.

This includes:

- Bridging assets to and from the L1,
- Sending them within your hyperchain,
- Checking historical transactions, and
- Managing contracts

You can also enhance its capabilities by running [the Block Explorer Indexer/API.](./block-explorer.md)
