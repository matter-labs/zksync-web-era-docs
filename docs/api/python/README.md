# Python SDK

:::warning
* We are currently updating the Python SDK and you may encounter errors when trying things out.
* Apologies for the inconvenience, we will update the documentation in due course.

While most of the existing SDKs should work out of the box, deploying smart contracts or using unique zkSync features, like paying fees in other tokens, requires providing additional fields to those that Ethereum transactions have by default.

To provide easy access to all of the features of zkSync Era, the `zksync2` Python SDK was created.
