# Contracts

`zksync-ethers` does not implement any new `Contract` class, since `ethers.Contract` fully works out of the box. However, for convenience, the library still re-exports this class.

Since deploying smart contracts on zkSync has some differences from deploying on Ethereum, there is a need for a specific `ContractFactory` method. It supports the same interface as `ethers.ContractFactory`.

In order to pay for smart contract interactions in ERC20 tokens, `customData` override should be used. You can read more about accessing zkSync features in [the next chapter](./features.md).
