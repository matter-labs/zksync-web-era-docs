# Front-end integration

This section describes how to make the most of zkSync to provide the best UX.


## Going to production rightaway

If your front-end code does not deploy new smart contracts, then no changes to the codebase are required! All the existing SDKs/infrastructure will work out-of-box.

## Enabling zkSync features

If you want to deploy smart contracts or enable advanced zkSync features, like account abstraction, then you need to use the `zksync-web3` library for that. You can read about the basics [here](./features.md).

If you want to see some code, check out our basic [tutorial](../../dev/building-on-zksync/hello-world.md) for full mini-dApp.
