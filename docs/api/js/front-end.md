# Front-end integration

This section describes how to make the most of zkSync to provide the best UX.

## Going to production rightaway

If your front-end code does not deploy new smart contracts, then no changes for the codebase are required! All the existing SDKs/infrastructure will work out-of-box.

## Enabling zkSync features

If you want to deploy smart contracts or enable advanced zkSync features, like paying fees in ERC20 tokens, then you need to use the `zksync-web3` library for that. You can read about the basics [here](./features.md).
