# `accounts` package

### `CallOpts`

Is the collection of options to fine tune a contract call request from an account associated with `AdapterL1`, `AdapterL2`, `Deployer` or
`Adapter`. Its primary purpose is to be transformed into `bind.CallOpts`, wherein the `From` field represents the associated account.

```go
type CallOpts struct {
	Pending     bool            // Whether to operate on the pending state or the last known one
	BlockNumber *big.Int        // Optional the block number on which the call should be performed
	Context     context.Context // Network context to support cancellation and timeouts (nil = no timeout)
}
```

### `FullDepositFee`

Represents the total ETH fee required for performing the deposit on both L1 and L2 networks.

```go
type FullDepositFee struct {
	MaxFeePerGas, // MaxFeePerGas of the L1 transaction if 1559 transaction is used.
	MaxPriorityFeePerGas, // MaxPriorityFeePerGas of the L1 transaction if 1559 transaction is used.
	GasPrice, // Gas price of the L1 transaction if legacy transaction is used.
	BaseCost, // Base cost of the L2 transaction.
	L1GasLimit, // Gas limit of the L1 transaction.
	L2GasLimit *big.Int // Gas limit of the L2 transaction.
}
```

### `CallMsg`

Contains parameters for contract call from an account associated with `AdapterL1`, `AdapterL2`, `Deployer` or`Adapter`. Its primary purpose
is to be transformed into [`types.CallMsg`](#callmsg), wherein the `From` field represents the associated account.

```go
type CallMsg struct {
	To         *common.Address     // The address of the recipient.
	Gas        uint64              // If 0, the call executes with near-infinite gas.
	GasPrice   *big.Int            // Wei <-> gas exchange ratio.
	GasFeeCap  *big.Int            // EIP-1559 fee cap per gas.
	GasTipCap  *big.Int            // EIP-1559 tip per gas.
	Value      *big.Int            // Amount of wei sent along with the call.
	Data       []byte              // Input data, usually an ABI-encoded contract method invocation

### `TransactOpts`

Contains common data required to create a valid transaction on both L1 and L2 using the account
associated with `AdapterL1`, `AdapterL2` or `Deployer`. Its primary purpose is to be transformed into
[`bind.TransactOpts`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum@v1.12.0/accounts/abi/bind#TransactOpts),
wherein the `From` and `Signer` fields are linked to the associated account.

```go
type TransactOpts struct {
	Nonce     *big.Int        // Nonce to use for the transaction execution (nil = use pending state).
	Value     *big.Int        // Funds to transfer along the transaction (nil = 0 = no funds).
	GasPrice  *big.Int        // Gas price to use for the transaction execution (nil = gas price oracle).
	GasFeeCap *big.Int        // Gas fee cap to use for the 1559 transaction execution (nil = gas price oracle).
	GasTipCap *big.Int        // Gas priority fee cap to use for the 1559 transaction execution (nil = gas price oracle).
	GasLimit  uint64          // Gas limit to set for the transaction execution (0 = estimate).
	Context   context.Context // Network context to support cancellation and timeouts (nil = no timeout).
}

func (t *TransactOpts) ToTransactOpts(from common.Address, signer bind.SignerFn) *bind.TransactOpts
```

### `Transaction`

Transaction is similar to [`types.Transaction712`](types.md#transaction712) but does not include the From field. This design is intended for use
abstraction which already have an associated account with `AdapterL2`. The From field is bound to the specific account,
and thus, it is not included in this type.

```go
type Transaction struct {
	To        *common.Address // The address of the recipient.
	Data      hexutil.Bytes   // Input data, usually an ABI-encoded contract method invocation.
	Value     *big.Int        // Funds to transfer along the transaction (nil = 0 = no funds).
	Nonce     *big.Int        // Nonce to use for the transaction execution.
	GasTipCap *big.Int        // EIP-1559 tip per gas.
	GasFeeCap *big.Int        // EIP-1559 fee cap per gas.
	Gas       uint64          // Gas limit to set for the transaction execution.

	AccessList types.AccessList // EIP-2930 access list.

	ChainID *big.Int            // Chain ID of the network.
	Meta    *zkTypes.Eip712Meta // EIP-712 metadata.

func (t *TransferTransaction) ToTransferCallMsg(from common.Address, opts *TransactOpts) clients.TransferCallMsg
```

	FactoryDeps     [][]byte       // An array of L2 bytecodes that will be marked as known on L2.

	// If the ETH value passed with the transaction is not explicitly stated Auth.Value,

	// of the transaction.
