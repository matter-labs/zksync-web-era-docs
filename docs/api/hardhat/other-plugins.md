### hardhat-gas-reporter

Although this plugin works out of the box, zkSync Era has a [ different fee model](../../dev/developer-guides/transactions/fee-model.md) than Ethereum so users should consider that when analysing the report generated by this plugin.

In addition, make sure to read about [local testing ](./testing.md).

[More information](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hardhat-gas-reporter)


## Unsupported plugins

### openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades

This plugin is currently not supported as it overrides tasks of the compiler and it's not compatile with the zkSync Era compiler. 

Note that proxy contracts are supported on zkSync Era, only this plugin is not supported currently but you can write proxies manually.

### nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers

The hardhat network is not recommended to test contracts that will be deployed on zkSync Era. We recommend using the [local setup to test your contracts](testing.md) as it will give you the same results as our testnet/mainnet.

This plugin is not compatible with the zkSync Era local setup for testing.
