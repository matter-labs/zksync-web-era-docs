# `hardhat-zksync-deploy`

This plugin provides utilities for deploying smart contracts on zkSync Era with artifacts built by the `@matterlabs/hardhat-zksync-solc` or `@matterlabs/hardhat-zksync-vyper` plugins.

## Prerequisite

To use the `hardhat-zksync-deploy` in your project, we recommend that:
  - You have a Node installation and `yarn` package manager.
  - You are already familiar with deploying smart contracts on zkSync Era. If not, please refer to the first section of the [quickstart tutorial](../../dev/building-on-zksync/hello-world.md).
  - You have a wallet with sufficient GÃ¶erli `ETH` on L1 to pay for bridging funds to zkSync as well as deploying smart contracts. We recommend using [our faucet from the zkSync portal](https://goerli.portal.zksync.io/faucet).
  - You know how to get your [private key from your MetaMask wallet](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key).

## Setup

[@matterlabs/hardhat-zksync-deploy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@matterlabs/hardhat-zksync-deploy)

Add the latest version of this plugin to your project with the following command:

::: code-tabs

@tab:active yarn

```bash
yarn add -D @matterlabs/hardhat-zksync-deploy
```

@tab npm

```bash
npm i -D @matterlabs/hardhat-zksync-deploy
```

### Exports

#### `Deployer`

The main export of this plugin is the `Deployer` class. It is used to wrap a `zksync-web3` Wallet instance and provides a convenient interface to deploy smart contracts and account abstractions. It's main methods are:

```typescript
class Deployer {

  /**
   * @param hre Hardhat runtime environment. This object is provided to scripts by hardhat itself.
   * @param zkWallet The wallet which will be used to deploy the contracts.
   * @param deploymentType Optional deployment type that relates to the ContractDeployer system contract function to be called. Defaults to deploying regular smart contracts.
   */
  constructor(hre: HardhatRuntimeEnvironment, zkWallet: zk.Wallet, deploymentType?: zk.types.DeploymentType)

  /**
   * Created a `Deployer` object on ethers.Wallet object.
   *
   * @param hre Hardhat runtime environment. This object is provided to scripts by hardhat itself.
   * @param ethWallet The wallet used to deploy smart contracts.
   * @param deploymentType The optional deployment type that relates to the `ContractDeployer` system contract function to be called. Defaults to deploying regular smart contracts.
   */
  static fromEthWallet(hre: HardhatRuntimeEnvironment, ethWallet: ethers.Wallet, deploymentType?: zk.types.DeploymentType)

  /**
   * Loads an artifact and verifies that it was compiled by `zksolc`.
   *
   * @param contractNameOrFullyQualifiedName The name of the contract.
   *   It can be a bare contract name (e.g. "Token") if it's
   *   unique in your project, or a fully qualified contract name
   *   (e.g. "contract/token.sol:Token") otherwise.
   *
   * @throws Throws an error if a non-unique contract name is used,
   *   indicating which fully qualified names can be used instead.
   *
   * @throws Throws an error if an artifact was not compiled by `zksolc`.
   */
  public async loadArtifact(
    contractNameOrFullyQualifiedName: string
  ): Promise<ZkSyncArtifact>

  /**
   * Estimates the price of calling a deploy transaction in a certain fee token.
   *
   * @param artifact The previously loaded artifact object.
   * @param constructorArguments The list of arguments to be passed to the contract constructor.
   *
   * @returns Calculated fee in ETH wei.
   */
  public async estimateDeployFee(
    artifact: ZkSyncArtifact,
    constructorArguments: any[]
  ): Promise<ethers.BigNumber>

  /**
    * Sends a deploy transaction to the zkSync network.
    * For now it uses defaults values for the transaction parameters:
    *
    * @param artifact The previously loaded artifact object.
    * @param constructorArguments The list of arguments to be passed to the contract constructor.
    * @param overrides Optional object with additional deploy transaction parameters.
    * @param additionalFactoryDeps Additional contract bytecodes to be added to the factory dependencies list.
    * The fee amount is requested automatically from the zkSync Era server.
    *
    * @returns A contract object.
    */
  public async deploy(
    artifact: ZkSyncArtifact,
    constructorArguments: any[],
    overrides?: Overrides,
    additionalFactoryDeps?: ethers.BytesLike[],
  ): Promise<zk.Contract>

  /**
   * Extracts factory dependencies from the artifact.
   *
   * @param artifact Artifact to extract dependencies from
   *
   * @returns Factory dependencies in the format expected by SDK.
   */
  async extractFactoryDeps(artifact: ZkSyncArtifact): Promise<string[]>
```

### Configuration

::: warning API changes in v0.6.x

- We advise developers to upgrade to the most recent version of this package.

:::

In the `hardhat.config.ts` file, specify zkSync Era and Ethereum networks in the `networks` object.


```typescript
networks: {
    goerli: {
      url: "https://goerli.infura.io/v3/<API_KEY>" // The Ethereum Web3 RPC URL (optional).
    },
    zkTestnet: {
      url: "https://testnet.era.zksync.dev", // The testnet RPC URL of zkSync Era network.
      ethNetwork: "goerli", // The Ethereum Web3 RPC URL, or the identifier of the network (e.g. `mainnet` or `goerli`)
      zksync: true
    }
},
// defaultNetwork: "zkTestnet", // optional (if not set, use '--network zkTestnet')
```

- `zkTestnet` is an arbitrary zkSync Era network name. You can select this as the default network using the `defaultNetwork` property.
- `url` is a field containing the URL of the zkSync Era node in case of the zkSync Era network (with `zksync` flag set to `true`), or the URL of the Ethereum node. This field is required for all zkSync Era and Ethereum networks used by this plugin.
- `ethNetwork` is a field with the URL of the Ethereum node. You can also provide network name (e.g. `goerli`) as the value of this field. In this case, the plugin will either use the URL of the appropriate Ethereum network configuration (from the `networks` section), or the default `ethers` provider for the network if the configuration is not provided. This field is required for all zkSync networks used by this plugin.
- `zksync` is a flag that indicates if the network is zkSync Era. This field needs to be set to `true` for all zkSync Era networks; it is `false` by default.

### Commands

`yarn hardhat deploy-zksync` -- runs through all the scripts in the `deploy` folder.

::: tip
The deployment scripts must be placed in the `deploy` folder.
:::

- To run a specific script, add the `--script` argument, e.g. `hardhat deploy-zksync --script 001_deploy.ts`. This runs script `./deploy/001_deploy.ts`.
- To run on a specific zkSync Era network, use the standard Hardhat `--network` argument, e.g. `--network zkTestnet`. The network with the name `zkTestnet` needs to be configured in the `hardhat.config.ts` file, with all required fields stated above, or specify `defaultNetwork` in `hardhat.config.ts` file.

::: tip

If network argument `--network` or `defaultNetwork` configuration are not specified, local setup with `http://localhost:8545` (Ethereum RPC URL) and `http://localhost:3050` (zkSync Era RPC URL), will be used. In this case zkSync Era network will not need to be configured in `hardhat.config.ts` file.
For more details about a dockerized local setup, check out [Local testing](./testing.md).
