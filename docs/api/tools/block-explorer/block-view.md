# Browse blocks

![Browse blocks!](../../../assets/images/block-tx.png "View blocks on zkSync")

The block explorer home screen, by default, displays the 10 most recent blocks in the chain.
View all blocks for a more complete overview of recent blocks, or click on a specific block number for details on that block.
The blocks page is also accessible via the top menu.

## View all blocks

You can click on a block number to see all the details of that specific block. If you want to browse more blocks, click the [Blocks](https://explorer.zksync.io/blocks/) section of the navigation menu. Use the pagination to navigate to the next page.

However, if you have already left the homepage, you can always search for any block by typing in the block number.

2. Transactions

- Consists of lists of all the transactions that were included in this block.

### Block headers

The following table should help explain what you’ll see in a block.
