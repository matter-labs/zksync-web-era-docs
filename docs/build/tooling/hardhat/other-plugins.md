# Community plugins

The following plugins were created by the community and tested on zkSync Era. Feel free to suggest new plugins by [creating a issue(feat request) at this page](https://github.com/matter-labs/hardhat-zksync/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feat&projects=&template=feature_report.md&title=).

## Supported plugins

::: tip Example project

Here is [a template project configured with all plugins mentioned below](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-hardhat-with-plugins). You can use it as a starting template for your projects.

:::

### hardhat-deploy

Multiple tasks for advanced deployments.

This plugin was [updated to support zkSync Era](https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy/pull/437) on version `0.11.26`.

[More information](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hardhat-deploy)

### typechain/hardhat

Automatically generate TypeScript bindings for smart contracts.

[More information](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typechain/hardhat)

### openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades

Plugin used to deploy and update upgradable smart contracts (proxies). Use the [hardhat-zksync-upgradable plugin](./hardhat-zksync-upgradable.md) which provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with the OpenZeppelin Upgrades Plugins within a Hardhat environment on zkSync.

### hardhat-contract-sizer

Generates a report of the bytecode size of the contracts in your project.

[More information](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hardhat-contract-sizer)

### hardhat-abi-exporter

Different options to export smart contract ABIs.

[More information](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hardhat-abi-exporter)

### hardhat-gas-reporter

Although this plugin works out of the box, zkSync Era has a [different fee model](../../developer-reference/fee-model.md) than Ethereum. Users should consider this when analysing the report generated by this plugin.

In addition, make sure to read about [local testing](../../test-and-debug/getting-started.md).

[More information](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hardhat-gas-reporter)

### hardhat-preprocessor

This plugin enables the pre-processing of contract source code prior to compilation.

::: warning CACHE_BREAKER Field Issue

The hardhat-preprocessor plugin adds the CACHE_BREAKER field to the list of libraries, which can lead to failed verification when using [hardhat-zksync-verify](./hardhat-zksync-verify.md) plugin. To prevent this, please include the `--no-compile` flag: `yarn hardhat verify --no-compile `.

## Unsupported plugins

### nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers

This plugin adds new methods that interact with the Hardhat network used for testing.

However, we do not recommend using the Hardhat network for testing contracts that will be deployed on zkSync Era. We recommend instead using the [in-memory node](../../test-and-debug/era-test-node.md) or the [docker setup to test your contracts](../../test-and-debug/dockerized-l1-l2-nodes.md) as they will give you the same results as our testnet/mainnet.

::: warning
The additional methods provided by this plugin are not compatible with the zkSync Era in-memory node or docker setup yet. Currently, we are working on adapting our in-memory node to ensure compatibility with hardhat-network-helpers.
