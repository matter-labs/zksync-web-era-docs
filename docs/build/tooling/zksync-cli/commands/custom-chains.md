# Using custom chains with zksync-cli

The [zksync-cli](../../zksync-cli/getting-started.md) tool provides a flexible way to add or edit custom chains, enabling you to specify your own chain configuration. This feature is essential for developers looking to interact with ZK Stack Hyperchains.

## Configuring Custom Chains

To add or edit a custom chain, use the following command:

```bash
npx zksync-cli config chains
```

Upon execution, you will be guided through a series of prompts to enter specific details for the custom chain, including:

- **Chain Name**: A unique identifier for the custom chain.
- **RPC URL**: The RPC endpoint URL for interacting with the chain.
- **Chain ID**: The unique identifier for the chain, crucial for transaction signing and validation.
- **Other Information**: Depending on the chain's requirements, you may need to provide additional information such as block explorer URLs.

## Using Custom Chains

Once a custom chain is configured, you can use it across various `zksync-cli` commands. All of your custom chains will be listed in the chain selection prompt, allowing you to select and use them as needed. You can also specify a custom chain directly using the `--chain` option, for example:

```bash
npx zksync-cli wallet balance --chain <custom-chain-key>
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while configuring or using custom chains, ensure your RPC URLs and Chain IDs are correct and that the network is accessible.
