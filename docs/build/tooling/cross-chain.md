# Cross Chain

### LayerZero

[LayerZero](https://layerzero.network) is an interoperability protocol that connects blockchains (50+ and counting), allowing developers to build seamless omnichain applications, tokens, and experiences. The protocol relies on immutable on-chain endpoints, a configurable Security Stack, and a permissionless set of Executors to transfer censorship-resistant messages between chains.
