# Building a Custom Paymaster

This tutorial shows you how to build a custom paymaster that allows users to pay fees with any ERC20 token. You will:

- Create a paymaster that assumes a single unit of an ERC20 token is enough to cover any transaction fee.
- Create the ERC20 token contract and send some tokens to a new wallet.
- Send a `mint` transaction from the newly created wallet via the paymaster. Although the transaction normally requires ETH to pay the gas fee, our paymaster executes the transaction in exchange for 1 unit of the ERC20 token.

## Prerequisites

- Make sure your machine satisfies the [system requirements](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-compiler-solidity/tree/main#system-requirements).
- A [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installation running Node.js version 16.
- Some familiarity with deploying smart contracts on zkSync. If not, please refer to the first section of the [quickstart tutorial](../../../quick-start/hello-world.md).
- Some background knowledge on the concepts covered by the tutorial would be helpful too. Have a look at the following docs:
  - [Account abstraction protocol](../../../developer-reference/account-abstraction.md).
  - [Introduction to system contracts](../../../developer-reference/system-contracts.md).
  - [Smart contract deployment](../../../developer-reference/contract-deployment.md) on zkSync Era.
  - [Gas estimation for transactions](../../../developer-reference/fee-model.md#gas-estimation-for-transactions) guide.
- You should also know [how to get your private key from your MetaMask wallet](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key).

:::

## Setup the Project

1. Initiate a new project by running the command:

```sh
npx zksync-cli create custom-paymaster-tutorial --template hardhat_solidity
```

This creates a new zkSync Era project called `custom-paymaster-tutorial` with a basic `Greeter` contract.

1. Navigate into the project directory:

```sh
cd custom-paymaster-tutorial
```

## Design

### Paymaster Solidity Contract

The contract code defines an ERC20 token and allows it to be used to pay the fees for transactions.

The skeleton contract looks like this:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";

import {IPaymaster, ExecutionResult, PAYMASTER_VALIDATION_SUCCESS_MAGIC} from "@matterlabs/zksync-contracts/l2/system-contracts/interfaces/IPaymaster.sol";
import {IPaymasterFlow} from "@matterlabs/zksync-contracts/l2/system-contracts/interfaces/IPaymasterFlow.sol";
import {TransactionHelper, Transaction} from "@matterlabs/zksync-contracts/l2/system-contracts/libraries/TransactionHelper.sol";

import "@matterlabs/zksync-contracts/l2/system-contracts/Constants.sol";

contract MyPaymaster is IPaymaster {
    uint256 constant PRICE_FOR_PAYING_FEES = 1;

    address public allowedToken;

    modifier onlyBootloader() {
        require(msg.sender == BOOTLOADER_FORMAL_ADDRESS, "Only bootloader can call this method");
        // Continue execution if called from the bootloader.
        _;
    }

    constructor(address _erc20) {
        allowedToken = _erc20;
    }

    function validateAndPayForPaymasterTransaction  (
        bytes32,
        bytes32,
        Transaction calldata _transaction
    ) external payable onlyBootloader returns (bytes4 magic, bytes memory context) {
        // TO BE IMPLEMENTED
    }

    function postTransaction (
        bytes calldata _context,
        Transaction calldata _transaction,
        bytes32,
        bytes32,
        ExecutionResult _txResult,
        uint256 _maxRefundedGas
    ) external payable onlyBootloader override {
    }

    receive() external payable {}
}
```

:::info

- Only the [bootloader](../../../developer-reference/system-contracts.md#bootloader) is allowed to call the `validateAndPayForPaymasterTransaction` and `postTransaction` functions.
- To implement that, the `onlyBootloader` modifier is used on these functions.
  :::

### Parsing the Paymaster Input

The paymaster pays the transaction fees and charges the user one unit of the `allowedToken` in exchange.

The input that the paymaster receives is encoded in the `paymasterInput` within the `validateAndPayForPaymasterTransaction` function.

As described in [the paymaster documentation](../../../developer-reference/account-abstraction.md#paymasters), there are standardized ways to encode user interactions with `paymasterInput`. To charge the user, we require that she has provided enough allowance of the ERC20 token to the paymaster contract. This allowance is done in the `approvalBased` flow behind the scenes.

Firstly, we check that the `paymasterInput` is encoded as in the `approvalBased` flow, and that the token sent in `paymasterInput` is the one the paymaster accepts.

```solidity
magic = PAYMASTER_VALIDATION_SUCCESS_MAGIC;

require(
    _transaction.paymasterInput.length >= 4,
    "The standard paymaster input must be at least 4 bytes long"
);

bytes4 paymasterInputSelector = bytes4(_transaction.paymasterInput[0:4]);
if (paymasterInputSelector == IPaymasterFlow.approvalBased.selector)  {
    (address token, uint256 minAllowance, bytes memory data) = abi.decode(_transaction.paymasterInput[4:], (address, uint256, bytes));

    // We verify that the user has provided enough allowance
    require(token == allowedToken, "Invalid token");

    //
    // ...
    //
} else {
    revert("Unsupported paymaster flow");
}
```

Next, we check the user provided enough allowance:

```solidity
// We verify that the user has provided enough allowance
address userAddress = address(uint160(_transaction.from));

address thisAddress = address(this);

uint256 providedAllowance = IERC20(token).allowance(
    userAddress,
    thisAddress
);
require(providedAllowance >= PRICE_FOR_PAYING_FEES, "Min allowance too low");
```

Finally, we check the price of transaction fees, transfer the ERC20 tokens to the paymaster, and transfer the correspondent gas fee from the paymaster to the bootloader to cover the transaction fees.

```solidity
// Note, that while the minimal amount of ETH needed is tx.gasPrice * tx.gasLimit,
// neither paymaster nor account are allowed to access this context variable.
uint256 requiredETH = _transaction.gasLimit *
    _transaction.maxFeePerGas;

try
    IERC20(token).transferFrom(userAddress, thisAddress, amount)
{} catch (bytes memory revertReason) {
    // If the revert reason is empty or represented by just a function selector,
    // we replace the error with a more user-friendly message
    if (revertReason.length <= 4) {
        revert("Failed to transferFrom from users' account");
    } else {
        assembly {
            revert(add(0x20, revertReason), mload(revertReason))
        }
    }
}

// Transfer fees to the bootloader
(bool success, ) = payable(BOOTLOADER_FORMAL_ADDRESS).call{
    value: requiredETH
}("");
require(success, "Failed to transfer tx fee to the bootloader. Paymaster balance might not be enough.");
```

::: tip Validate all requirements first
The [validation steps](../../../developer-reference/account-abstraction.md#the-validation-step) ensure that the paymaster won't throttle if the first storage read which has a different value from the execution on the API is a storage slot that belongs to the user.

This is why it is important to verify transaction prerequisites _before_ performing any logic and why we _first_ check that the user provided enough allowance before calling `transferFrom`.

    receive() external payable {}
}
```

## Create ERC20 Contract

For the sake of simplicity we will use a modified OpenZeppelin ERC20 implementation:

Create the `contracts/MyERC20.sol` file and copy/paste the following:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract MyERC20 is ERC20 {
    uint8 private _decimals;

    constructor(
        string memory name_,
        string memory symbol_,
        uint8 decimals_
    ) ERC20(name_, symbol_) {
        _decimals = decimals_;
    }

    function mint(address _to, uint256 _amount) public returns (bool) {
        _mint(_to, _amount);
        return true;
    }

    function decimals() public view override returns (uint8) {
        return _decimals;
    }
}
```

## Compile and Deploy the Contracts

The script below deploys the ERC20 contract and the paymaster contract. It also creates an empty wallet and mints some `MyERC20` tokens for the paymaster to use at a later step. In addition, the script sends `0.06ETH` to the paymaster contract so it can pay the transaction fees we send later on.

1. In the `deploy` folder, create the file `deploy-paymaster.ts` and copy/paste the following, replacing `<PRIVATE-KEY>` with your own:

```ts
import { deployContract, getWallet, getProvider } from "./utils";
import * as ethers from "ethers";

export default async function () {
  const erc20 = await deployContract("MyERC20", ["MyToken", "MyToken", 18]);
  const erc20Address = await erc20.getAddress();
  const paymaster = await deployContract("MyPaymaster", [erc20.address]);
  const paymasterAddress = await paymaster.getAddress();

  // Supplying paymaster with ETH
  console.log("Funding paymaster with ETH...");
  const wallet = getWallet();
  await (
    await wallet.sendTransaction({
      to: paymasterAddress,
      value: ethers.utils.parseEther("0.06"),
    })
  ).wait();

  const provider = getProvider();
  const paymasterBalance = await provider.getBalance(paymasterAddress;
  console.log(`Paymaster ETH balance is now ${paymasterBalance.toString()}`);

  // Supplying the ERC20 tokens to the wallet:
  // We will give the wallet 3 units of the token:
  await (await erc20.mint(wallet.address, 3)).wait();

  console.log("Minted 3 tokens for the wallet");
  console.log(`Done!`);
}
```

2. Compile and the contracts from the project root:

```sh
yarn hardhat compile
```

3. Execute the deployment script:

```sh
yarn hardhat deploy-zksync --script deploy-paymaster.ts
```

The output should be roughly the following:

```

```

:::tip

- Addresses and private keys are different on each run.
- Make sure you delete the `artifacts-zk` and `cache-zk` folders before recompiling.
  :::

## Using the Paymaster

1. Create the `use-paymaster.ts` script in the `deploy` folder, replacing the parameter placeholders with the details from the previous deploy step.

::: warning
Make sure you use the private key of the wallet created by the previous script as that wallet contains the ERC20 tokens.
:::

```ts
import { utils, Wallet } from "zksync-ethers";
import { getWallet, getProvider } from "./utils";
import * as ethers from "ethers";
import { HardhatRuntimeEnvironment } from "hardhat/types";

// Put the address of the deployed paymaster here
const PAYMASTER_ADDRESS = "<PAYMASTER_ADDRESS>";

// Put the address of the ERC20 token here:
const TOKEN_ADDRESS = "<TOKEN_ADDRESS>";

function getToken(hre: HardhatRuntimeEnvironment, wallet: Wallet) {
  const artifact = hre.artifacts.readArtifactSync("MyERC20");
  return new ethers.Contract(TOKEN_ADDRESS, artifact.abi, wallet);
}

export default async function (hre: HardhatRuntimeEnvironment) {
  const provider = getProvider();
  const wallet = getWallet();

  console.log(`ERC20 token balance of the wallet before mint: ${await wallet.getBalance(TOKEN_ADDRESS)}`);

  let paymasterBalance = await provider.getBalance(PAYMASTER_ADDRESS);
  console.log(`Paymaster ETH balance is ${paymasterBalance.toString()}`);

  const erc20 = getToken(hre, wallet);
  const gasPrice = await provider.getGasPrice();

  // Encoding the "ApprovalBased" paymaster flow's input
  const paymasterParams = utils.getPaymasterParams(PAYMASTER_ADDRESS, {
    type: "ApprovalBased",
    token: TOKEN_ADDRESS,
    // set minimalAllowance as we defined in the paymaster contract
    minimalAllowance: ethers.BigNumber.from(1),
    // empty bytes as testnet paymaster does not use innerInput
    innerInput: new Uint8Array(),
  });

  // Estimate gas fee for mint transaction
  const gasLimit = await erc20.estimateGas.mint(wallet.address, 5, {
    customData: {
      gasPerPubdata: utils.DEFAULT_GAS_PER_PUBDATA_LIMIT,
      paymasterParams: paymasterParams,
    },
  });

  const fee = gasPrice.mul(gasLimit.toString());
  console.log("Transaction fee estimation is :>> ", fee.toString());

  console.log(`Minting 5 tokens for the wallet via paymaster...`);
  await (
    await erc20.mint(wallet.address, 5, {
      // paymaster info
      customData: {
        paymasterParams: paymasterParams,
        gasPerPubdata: utils.DEFAULT_GAS_PER_PUBDATA_LIMIT,
      },
    })
  ).wait();

  console.log(`Paymaster ERC20 token balance is now ${await erc20.balanceOf(PAYMASTER_ADDRESS)}`);
  paymasterBalance = await provider.getBalance(PAYMASTER_ADDRESS);

  console.log(`Paymaster ETH balance is now ${paymasterBalance.toString()}`);
  console.log(`ERC20 token balance of the the wallet after mint: ${await wallet.getBalance(TOKEN_ADDRESS)}`);
}
```

2. Run the script:

```sh
yarn hardhat deploy-zksync --script use-paymaster.ts
```

The output should look something like this:

```txt
ERC20 token balance of the wallet before mint: 3
Paymaster ETH balance is 60000000000000000
Transaction fee estimation is :>>  568750000000000
Minting 5 tokens for the wallet via paymaster...
Paymaster ERC20 token balance is now 1
Paymaster ETH balance is now 59650952750000000
ERC20 token balance of the the wallet after mint: 7
```

The wallet had 3 tokens after running the deployment script and, after sending the transaction to `mint` 5 more tokens, the balance is 7 as 1 token was used to pay the transaction fee to the paymaster. The paymaster paid the fees for the mint transaction with ETH.

## Common Errors

- If the `use-paymaster.ts` script fails with the error `Failed to submit transaction: Failed to validate the transaction. Reason: Validation revert: Paymaster validation error: Failed to transfer tx fee to the bootloader. Paymaster balance might not be enough.`, please try sending additional ETH to the paymaster so it has enough funds to pay for the transaction. You can use [zkSync native bridge or ecosystem partners](https://zksync.io/explore#bridges) (make sure Goerli or Sepolia testnet supported by selected bridge).
- If the `use-paymaster.ts` script fails when minting new ERC20 tokens with the error `Error: transaction failed`, and the transactions appear with status "Failed" in the [zkSync explorer](https://explorer.zksync.io/), please reach out to us on [our Discord](https://join.zksync.dev/). As a workaround, try including a specific `gasLimit` value in the transaction.
