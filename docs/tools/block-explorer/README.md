## Block Explorer API

We’ve developed the [zkSync Era Block Explorer API](https://block-explorer-api.mainnet.zksync.io/docs) for developers to access [zkSync Era Block Explorer](https://explorer.zksync.io/) data directly via HTTP requests.

The [API](https://block-explorer-api.mainnet.zksync.io/docs) provides various endpoints for many use cases you might want in your app. It is compatible with [Etherscan API](https://docs.etherscan.io/), which makes it easy to transition your existing apps to zkSync Era network.

The following modules are supported:

- [Contract](https://block-explorer-api.mainnet.zksync.io/docs#/Contract%20API)
- [Account](https://block-explorer-api.mainnet.zksync.io/docs#/Account%20API)
- [Transaction](https://block-explorer-api.mainnet.zksync.io/docs#/Transaction%20API)
- [Logs](https://block-explorer-api.mainnet.zksync.io/docs#/Logs%20API)
- [Block](https://block-explorer-api.mainnet.zksync.io/docs#/Block%20API)

Check out the API documentation [API docs on Mainnet](https://block-explorer-api.mainnet.zksync.io/docs) | [API docs on Testnet](https://block-explorer-api.testnets.zksync.dev/docs)

:::note Note

The [API](https://block-explorer-api.mainnet.zksync.io/docs) does not fully cover all the functionality yet.
:::

We are working on additional endpoints to cover more use cases and to make developers’ experience better. Stay tuned for further updates.
