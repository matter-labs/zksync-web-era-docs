# Transactions

From [Ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/transactions/):

> Transactions are cryptographically signed instructions from accounts. An account will initiate a transaction to update the state of the Ethereum network. The simplest transaction is transferring ETH from one account to another. 

## Transaction data on Ethereum

From [Ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/transactions/):

> A submitted transaction includes the following information:
>  - `from`: the address of the sender, that will be signing the transaction. This will be an externally-owned account as contract accounts cannot send transactions.
>  - `recipient`: the receiving address (if an externally-owned account, the transaction will transfer value. If a contract account, the transaction will execute the contract code).
>  - `signature`: the identifier of the sender. This is generated when the sender's private key signs the transaction and confirms the sender has authorized this transaction.
>  - `nonce`: a sequentially incrementing counter which indicates the transaction number from the account.
>  - `value`: amount of ETH to transfer from sender to recipient (denominated in WEI, where 1ETH equals 1e+18wei).
>  - `data`: optional field to include arbitrary data.
>  - `gasLimit`: the maximum amount of gas units that can be consumed by the transaction. The EVM specifies the units of gas required by each computational step.
>  - `maxPriorityFeePerGas`: the maximum price of the consumed gas to be included as a tip to the validator.
>  - `maxFeePerGas`: the maximum fee per unit of gas willing to be paid for the transaction (inclusive of baseFeePerGas and maxPriorityFeePerGas).

## Transaction data on zkSync Era

Transactions on zkSync Era are similar to Ethereum transactions so you can use the same wallet as you use on Ethereum. There are some minor differences, mostly with regards to setting the fees.

For more information on fees in zkSync Era, read the [fee model documentation](./fee-model).

The following values are returned by any RPC call which outputs transaction details:

- `is_l1_originated`: `bool`
- `status`: `TransactionStatus`, one of `Pending`, `Included`, `Verified`, or `Failed`. See [Transaction statuses section](#transaction-statuses) below.
- `fee`: `U256`. See the [fee mechanism documentation](./fee-model.md) for more information.
- `initiator_address`: `Address`
- `received_at`: `DateTime<Utc>`
- `eth_commit_tx_hash`: `Option<H256>`
- `eth_prove_tx_hash`: `Option<H256>`
- `eth_execute_tx_hash`: `Option<H256>`

## Contract deployment differences between zkSync Era and Ethereum

Contract deployment is a special kind of transaction. A contract deployment creates a new contract account in the system. There are some differences for this kind of transaction between zkSync Era and Ethereum:

- Ethereum: Contract deployment occurs when a user sends a transaction to the zero address `(0x000...000)` where the `data` field contains the contract bytecode concatenated with constructor parameters.
- zkSync Era: To deploy a contract on zkSync, a user calls the `create` function of the [ContractDeployer](../../architecture/contracts/system-contracts.md#contractdeployer) and provides the hash of the contract to be published, as well as the constructor arguments. The contract bytecode is added to the `factory_deps` field of [EIP-712 transaction types](#eip-712-0x71). If the contract is a factory (i.e. it can deploy other contracts), the bytecode of all child contracts should be included in `factory_deps`.
- Find out more about [contract deployment](../../architecture/contracts/contract-development.md) on zkSync Era.

## Transaction types

For compatibility, the majority of zkSync Era transactions types are similar to those on Ethereum.

:::tip
The transaction type hex value is output by any RPC method call which returns a transaction type, such as [`eth_getTransactionByHash`](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-apis/api-documentation/) for example.
:::

### Legacy: `0x0`

The Ethereum transaction format used before the introduction of typed-transactions.

### EIP-2930: `0x1`

The Ethereum Improvement Proposal [EIP-2930: Optional access lists](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2930) addressed contract breakage risks introduced by EIP-2929. 

EIP-2930 transaction types contain everything from legacy transactions plus an `accessList` parameter containing an array of addresses and storage keys.

### EIP-1559: `0x2`

The Ethereum Improvement Proposal [EIP-1559: Fee market change for ETH 1.0 chain](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559) is an updated transaction type introduced in Ethereum's London fork. It addressed network congestion and excessive fees coming from bids. EIP-1559 transactions don't specify `gasPrice` and instead use a base fee which is adjusted by each block.

EIP-1559 transaction types contain everything from EIP-2930 and legacy transactions (apart from removing the `gasPrice`). 

Additional parameters added are the `maxPriorityFeePerGas` and `maxFeePerGas` where users can specify maximum fees they're willing to pay to prioritize their transactions.

- `maxPriorityFeePerGas`: Is the maximum fee users are willing to give to miners as an incentive.
- `maxFeePerGas`: Is the maximum fee users are willing to pay in total. This includes the `maxPriorityFeePerGas` and network-determined base fee per gas.

:::warning Important
zkSync Era supports the EIP-1559 transaction-type format but does nothing with the max fee parameters.

### EIP-712: `0x71`

The Ethereum Improvement Proposal [EIP-712: Typed structured data hashing and signing](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) introduced hashing and signing of typed-structured data as well as bytestrings. 

EIP-712 transactions access zkSync-specific features such as [account abstraction](../aa.md) and [paymasters](../../../dev/tutorials/custom-paymaster-tutorial.md). Furthermore, smart contracts must be deployed with the EIP-712 transaction type.

You can specify the additional fields, such as the custom signature for custom accounts or to choose the paymaster with EIP-712 transactions. These transactions have the same fields as standard Ethereum transactions, plus fields containing additional L2-specific data (`paymaster`, etc).

```json
"gasPerPubdata": "1212",
"customSignature": "0x...",
"paymasterParams": {
  "paymaster": "0x...",
  "paymasterInput": "0x..."
},
"factoryDeps": ["0x..."]
```

- `gasPerPubdata`: A field denoting the maximum amount of gas the user is willing to pay for a single byte of pubdata.
- `customSignature`: A field with a custom signature for the cases in which the signer's account is not an EOA.
- `paymasterParams`: A field with parameters for configuring the custom paymaster for the transaction. Parameters include the address of the paymaster and the encoded input.
- `factory_deps`: A non-empty array of `bytes`. For deployment transactions, it should contain the bytecode of the contract being deployed. If the contract is a factory contract, i.e. it can deploy other contracts, the array should also contain the bytecodes of the contracts which it can deploy.

To ensure the server recognizes EIP-712 transactions, the `transaction_type` field is equal to `113`. The number `712` cannot be used as it has to be one byte long.

Instead of signing the RLP-encoded transaction, the user signs the following typed EIP-712 structure:

| Field name             | Type        |
| ---------------------- | ----------- |
| txType                 | `uint256`   |
| from                   | `uint256`   |
| to                     | `uint256`   |
| gasLimit               | `uint256`   |
| gasPerPubdataByteLimit | `uint256`   |
| maxFeePerGas           | `uint256 `  |
| maxPriorityFeePerGas   | `uint256`   |
| paymaster              | `uint256`   |
| nonce                  | `uint256`   |
| value                  | `uint256`   |
| data                   | `bytes`     |
| factoryDeps            | `bytes32[]` |
| paymasterInput         | `bytes`     |

These fields are handled by our [SDK](../../../api/js/features.md).

### Priority: `0xff`

Since Ethereum L1 has no concept of interacting with other layers, this is a zkSync Era specific transaction type related to [L1 -> L2 transactions](../../../dev/how-to/send-transaction-l1-l2.md).

## Transaction statuses

Transactions in the [block explorer](https://explorer.zksync.io/transactions/) are always in one of the following statuses:

- `Pending`: In the mempool but not yet included in a block. 
- `Included`: Included in a block but the batch containing the block has not yet been committed.
- `Verified`: Included in a block and verified. Verified means the transaction has been committed, proven, and executed on the Ethereum L1 network.
- `Failed`: Unverified/failed transaction.
