zkEVM
zkEVM is a virtual machine that executes smart contracts in a way that is compatible with zero-knowledge-proof computation. Our zkEVM keeps EVM semantics, but is also ZK-friendly and adopts a traditional register-based CPU architecture.

zkSync Era Docs contain up-to-date information about zkSync Era. zkSync Era has built-in EVM compatibility which makes it a unified tool for releasing EVM-compatible ZK rollups. We call it zkEVM: web3, Layer 2, scaling functionality that preserves your battle-tested code and knowledge gained after years of working with Solidity.

Build and setup
Initial setup
The frontend team chose the yarn@berry package manager, so ensure you install node version LTS@14 after configuring yarn.

# configure yarn version: berry or specifically 3.1.1.
$ yarn set version berry
Main scripts
# install dependencies
$ yarn add

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
$ yarn docs:dev
# static generation to dist
$ yarn docs:build
Development
The continuous integration pipeline uses prettier and markdownlint to ensure there are no issues with your document, that spelling is correct, and there are no dead links.

You can check it locally as follows:

# check dead links
$ yarn lint:dead
# check spelling
$ yarn lint:spell
# check with markdownlint
$ yarn lint:mdl
# check with prettier
$ yarn lint:fmt
# fix with markdownlint
$ yarn fix:mdl
# fix with prettier
$ yarn fix:fmt
# run all checks
$ yarn ci
# run all fixes
$ yarn ci:fix
# build for production
$ yarn ci:build
If lint:spell doesn't recognize a word, and you’re sure that it’s correct, consider adding it to cspell-zksync.txt.

Contributions
Adding new tutorials
To add a new tutorial:

Fork the repository and create a new branch locally to add your changes.
Add the tutorial markdown file inside the docs/dev/tutorials folder.
Give the file an SEO-friendly name, as it is included in the live URL.
In the docs/.vuepress/config.js file, add the tutorial inside this block:
{
title: "Tutorials",
path: "/dev/tutorials",
collapsable: false,
children: [
  "/dev/tutorials/cross-chain-tutorial.md",
  "/dev/tutorials/custom-aa-tutorial.md",
  "/dev/tutorials/custom-paymaster-tutorial.md"],
  // ADD YOUR FILE HERE
},
If your tutorial contains images, make sure to compress them using https://squoosh.app/ before adding them to the docs/assets/images folder.
Finally, create a PR.
Deployment
The main branch is automatically deployed to https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/aqwzx-zksync-v2-docs

Deploying does the following:

Installs node modules.
Prepares, tests, and builds documentation.
Deploys everything contained in the dist folder as a static website.
yarn zk-ci-prepare
yarn firebase deploy
